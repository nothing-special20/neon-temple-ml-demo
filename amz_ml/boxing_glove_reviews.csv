I love the variety of colors to choose from. Now the cons; the padding is insufficient to say the least. I could see these being alright starter gloves for someone in boxing who is doing padwork or bagwork. Personally I find these gloves to lack wrist and thumb support which is helpful in preventing injury. I don't think I'll be using them because they do not fit in the wrist or thumb areas.

user|R2YCRX8RXUK3XR|B07L38V2X1|B07L37G3MK|Michael|3|April 16, 2023|1681610400|Awesome Design But Needs Some Improvements for Sweaty Hands|After testing the Hayabusa S4 Boxing Gloves for several weeks, my opinion is somewhat divided. The design is undeniably striking, and they do draw attention at the gym. Additionally, once they're on, they provide a comfortable, secure fit that offers ample support during training.Nonetheless, there are a couple of aspects that need improvement. Firstly, I found it quite challenging to insert and remove my hands from the gloves when they become sweaty. The inner lining seems to stick to my hands, which causes inconvenience during breaks in my training sessions. It would be great if the fabric were more resistant to moisture or designed to be more breathable.Another issue is the snugness of the 12oz gloves, which is the appropriate size for my weight category. While I appreciate the importance of a secure fit for better control, the gloves feel excessively tight. This makes it even more troublesome to wear and remove them, especially when factoring in the fabric problem.In summary, I rate these Hayabusa S4 Boxing Gloves with 3 stars. The impressive design and sense of security are commendable, but the inner fabric and fit could use some enhancements. If the manufacturer can address these concerns, these gloves have the potential to be a top-rated product. Until that happens, I'll be on the lookout for updates in future versions.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.712862

After about two weeks, I noticed that the material inside the glove was rubbing against my pinky, and eventually cut me. I thought it was because I had to break them in, but I'm still having the same issue. I believe it's because the gloves are not snug enough. I really do like the quality of the gloves. But they are still cutting my pinky, so I reached out Hayabusa for an exchange. They said that since they were purchased through Amazon they could not honor their “guarantee”.

After reading alot of reviews I decided to go with these as my first real pair. I was worried about the gloves fitting to tight as I've seen some other reviews say. And I will say they are somewhat difficult to put on with wraps. But once on I have no complaints, they feel great. Hoping through time I'll be able to slip them on better the more I use them.

Worked great for 2 months, then they started slowly tearing at strap where you put your hands. MAJOR FLAW - are wayyy to small around the wrists to properly support hand wraps. I use them 2-3 times per week max for cardio (not actually boxing), so not crazy usage for them to fall apart like that. Disappointed. Will not buy Hayabusa again.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.712904

The glove looks really sleek and ergonomically made. Having said that padding and looks aren’t everything. This glove seems to have a lot of stitching issues. My new pair out of the box had loose stitching on the elastic and the wrap around Velcro is not stitched on properly.Picture 1: Really good looking pair of gloves.Picture 2: Stitching in the elastic has come loose after trying the glove on with a traditional wrap.Picture 3 &4: The stitching for the Velcro is done poorly.The quality of the glove was so bad after just one trial. I still wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and tried the a few punches. The fit and comfort was there upon punching but considering the issues - this price is way too steep.The glove is so heavily padded that if you tend to wrap your hand heavily - it’ll be next to impossible to put these gloves on. You can forget about using these gloves with a quick wrap (given the quick wraps have gel padding - and pairing that with the stitching of this glove) you will most certainly have a torn glove within few rounds. This will probably only get worse once you build up some power behind your punches.My personal opinion - go for one of the cheaper ones if you are a beginner . This glove has nothing but looks. This lacks in most other categories. Hope this helps.PS: I purchased a second one to see if it was a one off - “NO” the second one also had stitching issues.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.712916

They're a little tough to get on initially with the wraps, but by the end of my first HIIT session with them, I was having very little difficulty donning and doffing the gloves. The 16oz gloves have plenty of padding, but you can still feel the satisfaction in those hard punches. Wrist support is solid and the neoprene thumb is GREAT for clearing the sweat from my eyes.

These S4 Hayabusa Gloves have super springy bounce back when you hit someone. Look at the photo to see how much springy foam there is ! It's like 2 plus inches ! No one complains about a hard shot. These are even better than my Hayabusa T 3 by a long shot. Better than my RDX 16oz. They are even better than my Fairtex BG 5 16 oz. leather Gloves. My friend has used his S4's2-3 times a week for 2 years and they look and feel brand new ! These are absolutely the Best Boxing Glove I ever used for ""sparring"". They feel light for 16 oz. and really protect my forearms when getting kicked in Muay Thai. If your looking for a great 'sparring glove"" these are an incredible value...! If your a big clinch fighter in Muay Thai you would need the Fairtex BG 5's or the like.

Dropped them off at UPS for free return, no box or bag needed. This is the typical return process for most items. I returned the second pair of gloves (the same gloves) and I was charged $6 for shipping at UPS as well as needed a box or bag to return, meaning I paid another $6 to ship it back.Poor experience overall. How was the return process different for each pair of gloves, even though they were the same product, company and return site.

The only reason that I gave it two stars is because I like the suede thumb concept. The first time that I used these gloves, with fully wrapped hands mind you, I hurt my wrist. It is utterly unacceptable to me for gloves that advertise their additional wrist support. That extra wrist support is actually the exact reason that I hurt my wrist. It makes the glove overly bulky and the strap doesn't secure much because of that. While it stops the wrist from moving up and down it does not stop the wrist from moving sideways. I am lucky that the injury was minor and had little effect on my training, but where I was lucky, you might not be.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.712962

Hayabusa T3 - ($150) Very well designed. the double velcro closure is the best closure system i've personally used.It has foam splints which both helps prevent unwanted wrist alignment if you fudge a hook and also from blocking hooks.Foam feels really good (14oz), enough protection and not like hitting with a pillow.I ultimately chose to keep this glove because of it's superior wrist support, which is specifically important to me due to recurring wrist issues.2. Hayabusa H5 - ($100) It's got a single strap closure, but the fact that it's partially elasticized makes it easy to get a secure closure on it.Foam feels pretty similar to the T3.The wrist splits seem to be only slightly less affective.overall i think this glove is a very high value.3. Hayabusa T3 LX - ($200) pretty much identical to the T3 but with leather.The colors are simple but elegant.I'm only rating this lower than the above because i think the $200 price tag lowers the value quite a bit.4. Hayabusa S4 ($50) - better wrist support then the below options, but the materials and fit definitely feel sub par to the above models.What really turned me off on this model is that the wrist closure just fits oddly, almost rectangular feeling.5. Sannabul Essentials Gel - very inexpensive.The materials and don't seem that bad, but the fit isn't as secure as i'd like.. literally no wrist support, you can just fold the glove in half at the wrist.6. Venom Elite -pretty much same deal as the sannabul but more expensive.Other notes, these gloves will last most people years and i think it's worth spending $100+ for some support and quality.I'd highly recommend you try the T3 but if you want a $100 cap i would go for the H5 or a good old pair of twins special gloves (which i've gone through three pairs of over the last 15 years). happy striking.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.713001

That said, I do hit the heavy bag a few times a week for fitness (some weeks more consistently than others, if I’m honest).My wife got these for me for Christmas about 18 months ago, and to be honest I wasn’t that exited about the gift. I had always bought a pair of training gloves at Target or Walmart, or ordered cheap ones on Amazon. And each pair would reliably wear out inside of 6 months, sometimes sooner (even after taping them to repair holes).These have been going strong for 18 months. They have some signs of wear, but are still comfortable, well-padded, and work fantastic. They cost double, and have lasted triple the time…still going. My wife was right… don’t tell her.

The first couple of times I hit the heavy bag with them they definitely felt tight and weird (for lack of a better term) but they broke in quickly and are now my go-to gloves for heavy bag work. These provide much more wrist support than my Sanabul training gloves and are snug but comfortable on my 5'11 male-sized hands. Honestly I cannot tell what on earth all the people who left 1 star reviews are talking about, as I have experienced none of it.That being said, I would have rated this product 2 or 3 stars had I written the review after my first heavy bag session, when they were not properly broken in. Other training gloves I've used have felt more or less ""natural"" right out of the box, while these definitely take some time.I love my new gloves! Also, for what it's worth, they look much prettier than my old ones, and the wine color is pretty baller! That being said if you are looking for a nice pair of training gloves, the Sanabul Essentials glove is also a good choice for heavy bag sessions. I believe they are considerably cheaper than these gloves, but won't do much to support your wrist so wrap your hands well :)"|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.713088

And those gloves were just fine. These are MUCH better.The moment you put these on you can feel how strong and well made they are. In person they look even better than the pictures. Every detail from how they look to the wrist support (epic), elastic (stretchy yet tough), velcro closure (seriously perfect), and the thumb fabric that you can totally use to wipe sweat off, gently swipe hair away from your face, and is firm enough to press the change song button on your headphones.Now, I’m all in for Hayabusa! Future purchases? Yes! The matching boxing shoes? Absolutely!On a performance level these actually step up your game for you. The quality is remarkable to the point that it makes me want to box even more. My other gloves are going in the donation pile.Be sure the check the sizing guide (it’s easy) and then go for it.

On the thumb is nice at first but starts to stink over time as you use it to wipe your sweat.I wipe my gloves down after every training session and there is still a noticable odor.Also mine started pilling at month 7 and it feels like it's scratching my face when I wipe.- The stitching that holds the hook portion of the velcro strap is starting to come undone.Not sure if it's fixable.Again, this is a glove I would recommend to people just starting out or have big hands.I would consider other options if you are more seasoned.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.713145

Hayabusa is so great!|I have been using this new pair for about a month, 3 times a week, for about an hr. each time. Heavy bag mostly. A great glove for the gym, workouts, light training, light sparing, limiyed bag work Break them in before Sparring with someone though 🤣🤣 (for their sake). If training heavy and alot get the T3's or at least go up to the leather version.Hayabusa makes a great glove. Dont buy the 10-$20$ cheaper gloved , get these. They take a few weeks to break in(like a snowboard boot). Really Tight at first, but I liked that.

It's a whole other level, boxing in well-fitting gloves. I'm doing partner-work and bag-work in these, and hit pretty hard, and feels great.That said, I am an avid beginner and these are just $50 bucks, so I would say--at the least--these are a great entry-level gloves and well-worth the upgrade from cheapo/too big/free gloves."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.713226

Returning.UPDATE--After reviewing the sizing chart it looks like a 14oz glove IS a medium sized glove. Very confusing, especially since the actual gloves have no information on themselves about how many ounces they are (there was a tag on them both with '12' on it, thus my belief they were 12oz gloves). Just put the sizing in the options along with the ounces to make it more clear. Despite me having actually receiving the right size these gloves run VERY small. My hands barely fit in them. My hand circumference is 8'' which is well under their listed smallest size for the 14oz ""medium"" glove. My hands wrapped are just under 10'' in circumference which should still fit in the 14oz glove according to their sizing recommendations. To give more context I am a woman at 240lbs with a hand circumference of 8'' unwrapped and 10'' wrapped. Should've had no problems with the 14oz glove, especially since I assume the sizing chart is based on men's hands since it doesn't specify. I have doubts that the 16oz glove would fit well based on how tight the 14oz glove was."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.713309

They are super tight around the wrist to the point where its very uncomfortable. When I hit the bag the gloves cause my hand to go downward which didnt happen with my old gloves so I know its not my form its the gloves. Hopefully they get better as I break them in but so far I havent made it through a whole workout in them, I have to keep taking them off and and putting my old gloves back on.

Bought these because I wanted to stop using the ones they have there and have my own so I consider myself a beginner.Only pro I have is that is has that suede material on the thumbCons:I’ve used them for a couple weeks and they’ve yet to “break in”They have this wrist support bar all along the glove until the edge of the knuckle. It is horrible, it supposed to be wrist support but it just flexes your whole hand down. Too sturdy to break that part in I feel like I don’t know what material that is.I have larger than normal hands, with wraps (which didn’t come with gloves) it is almost impossible to squeeze hand in glove, ruins the wraps trying to put glove on.Thumb placement is not right. May be due to my larger hands but just hurts on the top part of the thumb, only comparing to the gloves I’ve worn before.Knuckles scrape inside the glove when punching. Not knuckles when making a fist. But knuckles on the finger. The area that fits fine is only the area where you actually punch.I don’t know what material is inside the glove not only does your hand not fit flush allowing your fingers to kind of grip the glove or squeeze to make a fist, but the material just scrapes fingers when punching. Using these 2-3x per week and if I go a full session with these even on light punching, my fingers will bleed all over the glove.These are absolutely horrible. I don’t know how to make a glove by any means, but I can’t understand how they can actually sell this and who it’s for. I would recommend just staying with the known brands or talking to professionals who know more. But I feel ripped off.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.713485

I have three other pairs of 10 oz gloves and they are all a little roomy on me. These showed up and on the outside, they were comparable to my largest pair. Imagine my surprise when I went to put them on and it was like squeezing into a two-size-too-small shoe. The wrist padding is bulky and uncomfortable; I honestly think a hand wrap will do the same job with greater comfort. You can't squeeze a smartwatch under these things, and they force your hand into an unnatural position. I have no idea what the thought process behind these gloves was, but I'm confident that no actual human being tested them before they were sold.

They look good, they feel good but my only gripe is with the handwraps that came with the gloves. One of the wraps was torn significantly across the cloth close to the thumb loop. I have to cautiously wrap my hand so that I do not fully tear the hand wrap and it becomes unusable. So if it weren't for that then this would have been a five star review across the board because I like the feel of the hand wraps as well.

I'm a big fan of ""buy once, cry once,"" but these gloves seem to be doing great.I'm 175 and hit pretty hard on the heavy bag. Not much of a boxer, but I've been doing training for about 5 years now. I wore out my old Title trainers (which I also liked a lot). When I switched to these, I noticed they fit my hands extremely snugly (in a good way); however, if you have larger hands, I would maybe go with a different brand.Going to work on a new 100lb bag was an absolute pleasure. I thought they would be too tight reading other reviews, but I was able to make an adequate fist and strike with the correct knuckles. My old Titles would make my wrists hurt if I threw too many/too hard hooks. After 5 rounds, I did not have any pain in my wrists, and my knuckles were only slightly sore. The wrap it ships with is top notch too.Stitching is fine. Leather seems fine. No complaints or comments about the construction until I use them for a while.I train alone and don't spar (I'm not a competitive boxer anymore, I just do it to keep fit), but these do seem a bit hard for sparring. I cannot recommend them for sparring because of their hardness, but for putting some hate on a heavy bag they work amazing."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.713581

Usually in the $30-$40 range. Although those particular gloves have started to incorporate modern features such as wrist support and breathable palms, my hands still felt unsupported.I finally got the balls to treat myself and upgrade my gloves to something better and I'm glad I did. This upgrade was long overdue.After one workout with these Hayabusa gloves and my hands felt like they were fully supported all around. From wrist to finger tips, my hands felt at home, safe, and fully supported. These gloves felt like I was fighting with clouds on my hands. I could've gone 10 or 12 more rounds on the heavy bag. Usually I'm worried about my hands sliding around in my gloves, or afraid that my wrist will tweak even with the built in wrist support with the other gloves.I cannot say enough. I realize that these may only be a few steps up from my ""Everlost"" gloves. These are probably an entry level Hayabusa glove if I'm not mistaken..S4 series?Still. SO worth the upgrade. They are well constructed and are very supportive of MY hands and wrists. Very pleased.Delivery was prompt and arrived a day earlier than expected!!!Thank you!"|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.713624

I wouldn't recommend it for sparring, but it's perfect for bag and mitt work. However, the gloves are rather tight, especially with handwraps on, so I'd only get this if you have small or average sized hands, and you should order a size up. Aside from that, the gloves themselves are by far the most comfortable gloves I've used. The wrist support is very good, and your fists feel secure when they're in. Due to the interior being lined with fabric though, the gloves could be hard to put back on if your hands are sweaty. Overall, the gloves are perfect for beginners due to comfort and wrist stability, but there is some slight over-padding on the back of the hands and finger compartment that is unnecessary for more advanced boxers.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.713637

I liked the design and features like the sweat wipe on the thumb. Got the gloves on prime so 2 day delivery. The gloves also come with a pair of 180in. hand wraps. The wraps are thin and have a bit of stretch so they're comfortable but I'm used to 120in. wraps so they feel more bulky but that's just because of the extra 60in. Also the the velcro at the ends of the wraps extends past the attachment velcro so it catches on the gloves when you're trying to slip them on. Anyways, my major complaint is with the gloves. I ordered the 12oz cause figured i'm a woman so I have small hands and the gloves I got from my gym are 14oz and those fit my kinda big. They fit pretty nice and snug without wraps on but with them on they're almost too tight but not unbearable. I took off the tags and have used them about a week hoping that they just needed some breaking in but they're still pretty tight fitting. Moral of the story, don't take the tags off if you don't know if they're the right size. maybe the seller will take pity on me and let me have a bigger pair lol|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.713817

They are pretty tight though, to the point that they are very hard to get on/off (16oz) and that is without wraps on. Overall they seem like they will last a long time.

When I first got them, they were super tight and hard to take off after finishing but I think that was because I needed to break them in more or you can also not make them as tight as that is what I do now.

user|R1CTJEIZRAOOHT|B010HWJRI6|B09GL93V2D|Joshua|2|August 18, 2022|1660788000|subpar for the cost|I bought 6 gloves for comparison. Ranked from best to worst for my criteria:1. Hayabusa T3 - ($150) Very well designed. the double velcro closure is the best closure system i've personally used.It has foam splints which both helps prevent unwanted wrist alignment if you fudge a hook and also from blocking hooks.Foam feels really good (14oz), enough protection and not like hitting with a pillow.I ultimately chose to keep this glove because of it's superior wrist support, which is specifically important to me due to recurring wrist issues.2. Hayabusa H5 - ($100) It's got a single strap closure, but the fact that it's partially elasticized makes it easy to get a secure closure on it.Foam feels pretty similar to the T3.The wrist splits seem to be only slightly less affective.overall i think this glove is a very high value.3. Hayabusa T3 LX - ($200) pretty much identical to the T3 but with leather.The colors are simple but elegant.I'm only rating this lower than the above because i think the $200 price tag lowers the value quite a bit.4. Hayabusa S4 ($50) - better wrist support then the below options, but the materials and fit definitely feel sub par to the above models.What really turned me off on this model is that the wrist closure just fits oddly, almost rectangular feeling.5. Sannabul Essentials Gel - very inexpensive.The materials and don't seem that bad, but the fit isn't as secure as i'd like.. literally no wrist support, you can just fold the glove in half at the wrist.6. Venom Elite -pretty much same deal as the sannabul but more expensive.Other notes, these gloves will last most people years and i think it's worth spending $100+ for some support and quality.I'd highly recommend you try the T3 but if you want a $100 cap i would go for the H5 or a good old pair of twins special gloves (which i've gone through three pairs of over the last 15 years). happy striking.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.714279

I had hand wraps on, and could feel the pressure in my wrist when doing light work on the bag. Don't believe these have any sort of splint to keep your wrist straight. Padding is atrocius on the knuckle portion of the gloves. You are honestly better off with Everlast or somewhere in the 30$ range cause these gloves feel worse than any of those.

user|ROK18GVXOE4W2|B010HWJRI6|B010HWJRI6|Ricky|5|January 9, 2022|1641693600|Great glove overall for the price|I originally ordered a pair of fairtex gloves but the shipping time took too long and I needed something quick so I overnighted these venom gloves via prime. I ordered the 16oz gloves for reference. The quality, fit and finish is very nice. They don’t feel like they’re going to fall apart and they have a nice sturdiness to them. The material is not real leather but in reality it holds up and looks just as good as leather (other people won’t look down on you for having the synthetic leather). My hands fits just perfect in these gloves and I’m 190 pounds. Without wraps my hands are snug but not tight. With wraps they are tight but a perfect “tight” when nothing will move around but it won’t cut your circulation off either. The padding is really good in this glove as well. I don’t feel a thing when I hit the heavy bag many times during training with hand wraps on. I use these gloves for Muay Thai so if you’re looking for a pure boxing glove these probably won’t be the right shape. They have a lot of padding on the palm as well. Overall I’m very happy with my purchase and if you aren’t getting one of the Thai brands this is the next best thing for the price.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.714403

My partner can hit me pretty hard but the cushion in the gloves absorb the impact very well. The wrist support is really okay but these are more for Muay Thai so unlike boxing gloves it provides less support in the wrist and forearm area and more in the hand and fingers (You can just use wraps and apply an extra layer on the wrist if you want the support). I like these and have been using them about 3 times a week for 2 hours straight for over 4 months now and they still look fresh. Great buy and I would recommend this for beginners instead of getting a cheap pair that will last two months tops.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.714418

They make you position that hand and squeeze , you have plenty of wiggle room inside the glove not to much but enough to where your hand is protected. I don’t think I would spar with these the thumb you have to tuck that thumb in , it has too much wiggle room for my taste .

Super low quality for what they cost and they just feel like trash on your hands. They feel really cheap and low quality. Most importantly they lack wrist support. Not sure why these have such good reviews. I'll stick with my 50-60 dollar real leather Title gloves.

My first pair is a 16oz Fairtex, and second pair is 12oz Lupus gloves. This time around, I decided that I would spend a bit more for premium gloves that would further minimize the damage to the knuckles, wrist and ligaments from training. With research online, I was able to narrow the choices down but ultimately went with these 14oz Venum Elite Boxing Gloves. They sold me with ""handmade from Thailand"".After 1.5 months of use at 4-5x/week, these are by far the best gloves that I have tried. The outer shell/layer feels really durable, and there have been no signs of wear to date. What I appreciate the most is the flexibility of the synthetic leather! I started wearing knuckle guards recently as they were getting bruised and discolored with just hand wraps alone. (I work in hospital as a provider and purple knuckles make me look/feel like a wife beater)I bend the gloves slightly in a back and forth motion as I insert my hands/wraps/knuckle guard and I am able to get a good grip at the end while fitting everything into place. I tried to put on my 16oz fairtex gloves with the same setup and had a lot of trouble fitting everything inside comfortably. The padding is exceptional as well, I can barely feel the impact when working the heavy bag. I am also a big fan of the longer cuffs and larger velcro bc I can use my apple watch during workouts now. Overall, I could not be happier with my purchase. These have definitely exceeded my expectations and I will heavily consider Venum again should I need to get more gear in the future."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.714655

My original Everlast Walmart gloves were just not good enough for consistent 5-day / week heavy at workout sessions, and I figured it was time to upgrade. It took a few trial and error buys of different brands like Huyabusa to finally find the perfect set. These Venum Elites offer great padding support, former wrist support, and sufficient room for wrapped hands (large) to fit into. Can’t ask for more, I can feel a noticeable different in comfort and hand protection compared to the entry level Everlasts, and there’s a lot more room for wraps than the Huyabusas offered. Based on the price tag I would be hesitant to recommend to beginners but if you’re decided you want to commit to boxing I highly recommend these.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.714693

The only thing that’s a “negative” is that the color is not a true white. It looks more like a beige/cream with white accents which I figured anyways.

I box once a week so i want to say I’ve had about 10 sessions for about a 30-45 time frame of hard contact. I’ve been boxing for a long time and know when i come in contact with good gloves. The padding is great, i don’t feel a thing when i hit hard. I also use hand wraps when i box, so the cushioning is even greater. I highly suggest wearing hand wraps with any gloves to give your knuckles extra padding and to keep your wrists tight. I got the 14 oz gloves . I’m 6ft 190pounds with above average hands and they fit great. I haven’t noticed any sign of wear. These are a great glove to use for heavy bag and I’m sure they are fine as well for sparring and contact boxing. They are reasonably priced as well. Hope this helps|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.714991

Look great, initially very supportive and well padded. But after 5 weeks of kickboxing 3-5 times/week, the right glove seems to be collapsing when I punch. It's also causing some wrist rotation and obviously knuckle pain. Figured it was worth spending more for a higher quality glove but it's not what I got. Was so bad in class last night I switched to old Everlasts that the school has!.

They are excellent.|For some time now I have used a pair of 24 oz. gloves, which I absolutely adore (Ring to Cage), they are incredibly well built and they take a punishing. Typical heavy bag sessions for me are an hour and I do hit hard the entire time. In order to change things up and work on speed a bit more, I purchased a pair of 12 oz. Venum Elite Boxing Gloves. First, the experience was a rush...I really was able to move a lot quicker. Second, the padding in these 12 oz. gloves is amazing. Absolutely amazing. The hand compartment was perfect. I was able to get my hand wraps on and into the glove without a problem. I was worried that the 12 oz. ones might be designed for someone with smaller hands. No worries. Really thankful for these gloves -- again, amazing protection, even when hitting hard (make sure you have hand wraps too).|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.715131

I bought the first two each for $35 and they got destroyed really fast, the glove just ripped apart and the padding was all over the place everytime I hit a bag or a pad.That time I decided to put more money into my training gloves since I'm training every single day for two hours apart from sparring where I use different gloves.I still use them now (almost 6 months) and they are amazing. The padding is still intact from outside, I mean, no cuts thru or holes. Maybe a little inside, but nothing's coming out.Although I wouldn't recommend these gloves for advanced or for sparring. Since you're hitting hard every day, you need a good wrist support which these gloves lost after couple of months of daily using. The padding is amazing for sparring, even with the 14oz, but I still recommend 16oz for beginners.Next time I might try Hayabusa ones for $169 lol if that's worth the money.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.715461

The multi-layered foam padding is like a fluffy cloud that absorbs impact, saving your hands and wrists from unnecessary strain. It's like having a bodyguard for your fists! Plus, they've even thought about accidental eye pokes with the thumb enclosure. Safety first, folks!But wait, there's more! These gloves are versatile, catering to all your combat sport needs. Whether you're into boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, or MMA, the T3 gloves have got you covered.

Awesome gloves|I bought the Fairtex BGV1 gloves first and had a ton of knuckle pain (more in my right hand than left, but had pain on both sides) everytime I used them. The material on the outside also appeared to be thin.The Fairtex gloves do look great and I was excited about using them, but the knuckle pain was too much to ignore. Even after giving 2 weeks between sessions, the pain would come back. Really disappointed, especially after reading the great Fairtex reviews from everyone. I tried different hand wraps, quick wraps, extra wrapping, etc before switching away from the Fairtex gloves.I ended up buying the Hayabusa T3 Boxing Gloves to replace the Fairtex gloves along with extra long Gold brand wraps, and there was a immediate difference, no more knuckle pain, even after doing multiple sessions a week.The quality of these gloves is simply better, from the knuckle protection, to internal lining, outside material, to the wrist wrap, and fit and so on. There's a night and day difference between the free gym gloves and Fairtex BGV1 gloves (both 16 ozs).I'm no expert, but, if you've experienced knuckle pain, I would give these a shot. These gloves got me back to Muay Thai training immediately after using them. I don't have to ice anymore and take two weeks off in between to recover.This product definitely matches the positive reviews!|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.715609

First and foremost the wrist support is absolutely unmatched. I have terrible wrists and carpel tunnel but these gloves keep them as straight as an arrow. The protection they offer on the back of the hands is extremely solid, there a thick padded panels that absorb energy super well. My absolute favorite feature is the microfiber like material on the thumb to wipe sweat away. It sounds silly but it’s such a luxury. The 2 strap Velcro system is extremely secure, it is a little goofy to get both gloves on but if you bite the straps you can get them on and off super quick. I genuinely don’t have a bad thing to say and can definitely say it is worth to spend the extra money for this glove vs others. The Roll Royce of boxing gloves.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.715620

I think they would be great forsomeone with smaller hands who can't hit very hard, super tight.But I'm a heavyweight, and even my lighter punches are still a little to much for these gloves. I didn't make it 3 rounds until my knuckles started wearing out, 3 rounds later they were too sore to continue. I don't have especially big hands and these gloves are super tight, parts of my hands were becoming numb and sore from being sqeezed to death in these gloves. I tried a gell knuckle guard to add more protection for my knuckles but the gloves were so tight it honestly just made things worse. For the price it's really not worth it, I believe these gloves would be best suited for smaller people who are maybe taking a boxing fitness course and not anyone trained to throw a decent punch, but really if that's the case you can just get some cheap Everlast gloves. As far as wrist support goes its unmatched, I have garbage wrists.... they are like a bags of marbles at this point. The support is so solid I mean you almost can't hurt your wrist. Even though i apprstiate the wrist support myslef, Its not ideal for someone trying to learn proper punch form, these gloves will form some definite bad habits. If these were a little bigger and had some serious knuckle protection these gloves would be great. Looks like I'm back to 300 dollar winning gloves or the title Gel rush bag gloves.

I've noticed that my thumb gets jammed a little with hard hook punches if I don't wrap my hands with wrist wraps. One of my instructors in the class has the same experience, but after doing a few google searches, I didn't find anyone else online who had a similar issue, so take what you will from my feedback. I will use wrist wraps to see if the problem gets better, but I do feel like i should be able to throw pretty hard at a bag without wraps and not jam my thumb.I'm reasonably experienced (not a pro, but have done martial arts my whole life), and using these for Muay Thai currently.

Hayabusa T3 - ($150) Very well designed. the double velcro closure is the best closure system i've personally used.It has foam splints which both helps prevent unwanted wrist alignment if you fudge a hook and also from blocking hooks.Foam feels really good (14oz), enough protection and not like hitting with a pillow.I ultimately chose to keep this glove because of it's superior wrist support, which is specifically important to me due to recurring wrist issues.2. Hayabusa H5 - ($100) It's got a single strap closure, but the fact that it's partially elasticized makes it easy to get a secure closure on it.Foam feels pretty similar to the T3.The wrist splits seem to be only slightly less affective.overall i think this glove is a very high value.3. Hayabusa T3 LX - ($200) pretty much identical to the T3 but with leather.The colors are simple but elegant.I'm only rating this lower than the above because i think the $200 price tag lowers the value quite a bit.4. Hayabusa S4 ($50) - better wrist support then the below options, but the materials and fit definitely feel sub par to the above models.What really turned me off on this model is that the wrist closure just fits oddly, almost rectangular feeling.5. Sannabul Essentials Gel - very inexpensive.The materials and don't seem that bad, but the fit isn't as secure as i'd like.. literally no wrist support, you can just fold the glove in half at the wrist.6. Venom Elite -pretty much same deal as the sannabul but more expensive.Other notes, these gloves will last most people years and i think it's worth spending $100+ for some support and quality.I'd highly recommend you try the T3 but if you want a $100 cap i would go for the H5 or a good old pair of twins special gloves (which i've gone through three pairs of over the last 15 years). happy striking.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.715741

Shubb|5|June 20, 2022|1655690400|Immediately my favorite gloves|I started kickboxing about a year ago but have been boxing on and off for years.We don't use hand mitts at this gym, so I knew my basic Everlast were not going to be enough long term.I tried about 5 different pairs over the last year. I seem to have big hands, once I get the hand wraps in, my hands feel really snug in the gloves. I liked the Hayabusa H5's I bought because they have the sweat wicking thumbs, but they were really stiff and hard to break in.After 2 other gloves (including a $120 pair of leather ones) didn't satisfy me, I decided to try the T3's. I was initially concerned about the high price, the double velcro strap system (I am one of those guys who uses their teeth to lock and unlock my gloves) and the break in period.After 1 use, I noticed that the T3's fit my hands really well from the start. 3 uses and they feel like I've worn them forever and are just an extension of my hand. The double velcro is super easy to get in and off, and I LOVE the microfiber thumb for wiping off sweat. I get great wrist support (even without hand wraps) and they don't feel too small when I do wear wraps (which is most of the time).Highly recommend the T3's. Totally worth the price.

I have pretty bad wrists from a decade and a half of HEAVY weight training and the Hayabusa T3s help with extra support. It is worth mentioning that if you plan on DOING COMPETITIVE BOXING, YOU CANNOT USE THESE GLOVES! I used them from heavy sparing and bag/mit work. One of the guys in my boxing class put it to me this way, he said, “ I wanted to spend a decent amount of money on a pair as motivation to get my moneys worth out of them.” I followed suit. Now the majority of us have these gloves as our practice gloves. In our gym we spar with 16oz gloves. The added wrist support is your friend believe me. I also bought the cheaper Hayabusa S4s and there is no comparison. If you are serious about learning to box or need a new set of gloves to motivate you to get your butt into the gym, look no further.

I gave the shin guards aways and switched to Venum, the in/out of the shin guards when sweaty (and that's always the case when fighting) sounded good for the ""staying in place"" concept, but a) they don't really stay in place b) adjustments made are not easy and c) taking the off or back on is a hazzle, no ideal, I prefer velco straps. Now to the gloves, certainly, as promised, high end and quality, loved that. BUT, after 1 1/2 years of use (training 2 to 3 times per week), the ""wipe away sweat thumb) turns out a waste. Yes, it wipes away your sweat, but to the cost of the gloves lifespan. These are, on average, expensive gloves, high end. They are in perfect conditions, love as well the interlocking velcro wrist straps, what I shame that I have to toss them, simply because the sweat thumb feature opened up on both end, from wiping sweat away, and now make the gloves unusable, depsite that they are otherwise in mint condition, very upsetting. I have attached pictures only to show the quality of the gloves, but the shortcomings that the sweat thumb causes, thus my recommendation for all leather. The only other thing, if you are truly into Muay Thai, where there is a lot of ""catching"" on the kicks and holding, as well as grapping behind head for knee kicks, they don't open up as easily as some other gloves I used."|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.715826

I've been using these daily with mitt work/heavy bag and here's what I have to say:-Padding and build quality are well done. Great impact and feedback when hitting with these gloves. I have not noticed any durability issues so far.-They look amazing. Got the black/gold. The design is sleek and stylish but note that the thumb area is made of a different suede-like material which makes it a shade lighter than the rest of the glove.-It's almost impossible to move your wrist with all the splints on the back of the glove but the wrist protection offered by these gloves is right in line with all the fancy advertising.-The gloves fit snug. I have big hands and it took some effort to fit them in after first using them but the gloves have broken in. I can't fit my hands in with thicker/Mexican style wraps but Hayabusa wraps work fine. This would be a bigger issue if the gloves didn't provide the wrist support they do.-Good ventilation. I've sweat in these a lot and there's no noticeable smell.Overall, I can wholeheartedly recommend these gloves. There are definitely more budget friendly gloves that will get the job done but if you're willing to invest in a good pair these won't disappoint you.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.715840

I bought the 16oz. They feel totally secure and safe. My wrist, knuckles, and hands feel SUPER protected. You can hit really hard with these with minimal impact to your fists or wrists. The splints make it practically impossible for your wrists to bend, especially in addition to your hand wraps, and the double straps allow you to tighten it to your desired level. These things are awesome, really. The black and gold looks super bad@ass too. I would recommend these for advanced level and beginner level as well. Beginners don't have their technique and fundamentals down yet, so these would protect them and allow them to train and learn safely. If they're going to take it seriously, you might as well get gloves that are legit, instead of messing around with flimsy cheaper beginner gloves that allow the possibility of injury. For advanced trainers, these gloves have all the comfort and safety functions needed to train as hard as you want, whether it be sparring or hours of bag work. The thumbs allow you to wipe sweat also, which I've quickly realized is a huge underestimated added bonus. They are well worth the price. You can tell that as soon as you open them. Only one little minor ""gripe"", or ""suggestion"", is that I wish they came with their own carry bag, so I didn't have to just throw them in my training bag with everything else, but I will purchase one. The quality of these is top notch, but whenever they do wear out I'll be buying another pair for sure."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.715846

I use them for heavy bag workouts, not so much for any sparring. Overall I’ve been really happy with them, but I can’t say anything for durability as I’ve only had them for a couple months now.Materials feel great and durable. I don’t feel like they are going to fall apart anytime soon. The gloves have a double velcro strap system that really helps make the gloves feel secure as well as wrist support. They do feel a bit tight when using wraps underneath, but that should be expected. Padding is great and impact when throwing punches feel solid, not a ton of movement in the glove at all.

After a year of using those Venoms an hour a day / 5 days a week they were starting to wear to the extent I thought them compromised for wrist support and decided to get a new pair. I stumbled upon these Huyabusa T3s and decided to give them a try to see if the 2x price tag really made a difference.It makes a difference. These Huyabusa T3s are the next tier up. The outer leather is tough and when clenched feels like a brick. The wrist support is phenomenal, almost daring you to try throwing crosses into a steel door. These gloves feature twin Velcro straps that allow extremely tight wrap around the wrists, but can take a minute to get used to. The sweat wicking thumbs is also a nice and useful touch.These gloves are snug; they can accommodate hands with handwraps, but I’ve noticed thick 200in wraps are too much and can cause discomfort. For reference I have large hands with a 9in circumference around the palm, and I bought the 12oz T3s.I can’t decide if these are the right choice for you, but I can verify they are extremely good quality gloves and a noticeable step up from Venom Eites.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.715905

I have had wrist problems for many years and have continued to upgrade gloves to get better knuckle protection and most importantly for me wrist support. These are my sixth pair of gloves and although they are pricey they are the best I’ve ever owned. I only box once a week as part of my cardio so not very heavy use but the first time I tried these without wraps on I had no wrist pain which I sometimes get and then the next time I tried them with wraps on and although the fit was very snug it was not uncomfortable and no pain then either or in subsequent uses. The more you use the gloves the more comfortable the fit with the break in period without compromising any support!

After 3.5 months they broke down and I turned to the T3. The difference is incredible. With the first pair of gloves I’d feel most of the impact from my punches (yes I wear wraps). Also my wrist never felt secure. Wrist security and stability is especially critical for beginners who are learning technique and form. Otherwise injury is more likely to happen. The T3 absorbs my blows very well. I’m a large guy (240lbs) and I throw my punches well. Also- my wrists feel safe and secure which means I don’t have to hold back on my hooks.At first the glove seemed to be overpriced—but as I researched and compared the T3 to others, I found that the T3 comes in at a great price. Then after using the them for 3 weeks, I’m a sold. I’ll buy them again when I need to replace my current set.I love that they are ventilated well and look good. Everyone comments on the gloves at the gym. The look isn’t all that matters but it doesn’t hurt.I’m not a pro and I use the gloves for HITT and garage work and they are great.

The paddings on these gloves are very thick, and the gloves are quite large making it a good set of sparring gloves but I would strongly suggest not to practice power with them.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.715997

Microfiber thumb is questionable; recommend darker colors.|Got the white and gold gloves. Looks great in a jpeg, but is underwhelming in person, largely due to the microfiber thumb. It contrasts greatly with the rest of the glove and makes it look kinda cheap. I also greatly dislike that the microfiber stains easily, which makes it stand out from an otherwise slick looking glove - and that's something I do not enjoy after spending $139. Likely more of a problem with the gloves I got since they're lighter; would like feedback from others that have darker gloves.Padding is excellent. Can tell the quality right away from a cheap glove. I can go really hard on a bag and my hands feel fine. The velcro in the middle of the palm can make it feel a little too tight though, especially if your hands are close to the max size allowed for the glove (I do have some gorilla hands for my size). The double wrist wrap is extremely tight and can be awkward to put on by yourself, but it's possible and eliminates the need for wrist wraps.Overall, they are excellent gloves. To be honest, you can get similar quality gloves between the 70 to 100 dollar range - I paid extra for the aesthetic, which I'm torn over because of how much the microfiber thumb stands out. Other than that, Hayabusa did an excellent job with the design.For the record, these are BAG GLOVES and are not recommended for sparring.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716055

Originally, I ordered the 14oz black T3s with iridescent accents. They were beautiful, but they are VERY flashy and reflective and they were a bit blinding to my sparring partners. They were also a bit more snug in the fingers than I prefer (my previous gloves were Titles with a bit more space). I have pretty small hands and was surprised by how snug they were. If you like snug, these are perfect for you! I, however, prefer to have a little wiggle room and always wrap my hands. I exchanged the flashy 14oz pair for the 16oz purple and black T3s. These are perfect! Just a little more wiggle room for my fingers and no reflective areas blinding my opponents. They are very high quality and supportive. I love them!|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716084

I work the bag almost daily. I hit hard and often and I need a glove that doesn’t leave my hands aching and my knuckles bruised.I brought these gloves because I was intrigued by professed technological advances in theirconstruction.I can say after a little under 2 weeks of use that these a great training and bag gloves.They are comfortable, well made and provide superior protection for your hands.They are stiff out of box but my hand posture is breaking into that of the glove.They run true to size and the weight is well distributed.The wrist support is better than any glove I have ever worn outside of lace up models. These gloves have the wrist support for beginners, although there is somethingto say for act of a spraining your wrist in teaching proper form and building strength, but the benefits of not getting injured and missing workouts is an equally valid counter argument. The wrist support is universally a good thing and a unique feature on these gloves.The padding is superb and distributes the impacts nicely.I have been striking bags for close to 40 years and over that time have used and owned dozens of gloves.These gloves are worth every penny and are suitable for all sizes and experience levels.Update July 21.These are great gloves they have held up really well, still nice and stiff and they have not developed the slightest sign of wear after over 100 work outs.Great choice and well worth the moneyUpdate Feb 23.I have used these gloves for close to 2 years over a thousand rounds and over 100,000 punches.These gloves are beginning to show the slightest signs of wear. The lining on my jab hand has a small tear and the padding on my power hand shows some depression or more appropriately it’s beginning to telegraph my knuckles.The outside of the gloves show no signs of wear. All the stitching is as good as new and the outside shell has no signs of wear.I am going to purchase a new pair this spring so I can alternate the gloves between workouts.These are the best gloves I have ever worked out with.I would recommend them to anyone|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716103

I love how these gloves feel and the extra wrist loop really supports the wrist. However after daily use I have to stop my workout prematurely due to the fact that these gloves cause excessive knuckle pain. At first I thought it was due to ring rust and because I have not boxed in a few years. I figured it would be maybe a week to break in my knuckles and the gloves but almost a month of full use later I am still having to remove the gloves after about 20-30 minutes. I am wrapping my hands properly but I cant seem to figure it out. I consider buying gel inserts but at that point I might as well look elsewhere for a proper boxing training glove. How could you be ok with buying a brand new item and having to invest more money into it because of its lack of support/density foam when its main intended purpose is to hit something?... I am a normal sized guy, 5 10"" about 190 pounds. Unfortunately I would not recommend these gloves.

And the best customer service as well!|"I'm 5'3"", 140 pounds but was hesitant to get 10oz gloves. On the sizing chart, I was on the cusp of 10oz and 12oz gloves, and I opted for the 12oz ones thinking it would provide more protection and hand space. 12oz was amazing! But over time I really wanted to train with a lighter glove and was curious about the 10oz. I reached out to customer service to understand if the 10oz glove had less protection. They assured me that all T3 gloves offers the same amount of protection regardless of size and that the only difference between them was just the overall size and weight. I ordered a 10oz to try it out, and it was perfect. Same amount of protection, if not more, because it fit me more snuggly and felt better overall. I love how flexible they are with returns and it allows you to really test out the sizes to find the best fit for you.The gloves themselves are amazing, no complaints at all. The key highlights for me is obviously the wrist protection, the overall hand protection with the high quality impact foam, and the smaller, slimmer overall profile. It's less bulky than an average boxing glove which is better for me, since I like to do kickboxing too and I'm overall smaller in stature. Less bulkiness has really improved my overall training.

I got a 10oz and it weighted 9.2 each glove. Then me and a friend got the lx t3 version of this glove. I got 14oz and my friend got the 16oz. The 14oz weighted 12.9 and 13.5. My friends 16oz weighted 14.5 each. Really underweight. So we returned all of those(Sorry Hayabusa) and got a pair the t3 again but in 18oz this time. They came today and mine weighted 17.1 each. Which is what I wanted ultimately. A glove atleast 16oz or heavier lol. Ok Now the reason why I still rated this 5 stars after all that mess. I have wrist issues and this glove is no hype at all. It has the best wrist support ever. I mean my god is it good, I can finally go full force on the heavy bag again. It is so protective and very comfortable. So I couldn’t rank it lower since it fits my needs so well. I hated my wrist hurting after throwing a shot to hard. I got the all black, fake leather never looks good in colors, but in black it’s usually pretty good. I prefer the lx glove it was so gorgeous but there 16oz was barely 15 oz. which would work great for someone looking for that or even a 14oz glove. But I wanted a 16 or heavier so the 18oz worked out for me. So yea order a size up. The gloves are great. Really great. The lx model is nicer but same performance but they don’t have a 18oz wish they did or wish they were just true to size to begin with. Ugh‼️ Hoping this helps someone|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716236

These are by far the most comfortable, supportive gloves I’ve ever worn. I haven’t really broken them in yet so can’t comment for sure on durability, but the materials are great and it seems very well made. The closure system is slightly more difficult than a standard hook and loop closure (and obviously easier than lace up) but I fee like it offers a much better fit.

I’ve used Venum gloves for a 7 years and went through two pair. I thought let me try Hayabusu. I knew of the brands durability, but pricey product. I’m put them on my hands and boxed a few round and they are some sturdy, good gloves. The only thing I don’t like is that when I take my hands out there are a bi*tch to put back on lol not a big deal, maybe I need to wear them in. Other than that these are some nice gloves and I’m sure they will hold up for a very long time. Once this corona virus is over and I get back to the UFC gym, that will be the test. I also brought this because I hurt my ring finger with the venum gloves. That’s one of the big reasons why I brought these gloves. The only reason why I didn’t buy them in the past is because of the price. You get what you pay for So I got these Hayabusa gloves for more protection and durability and I’m happy with my purchase.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716386

I've used Cleto Reyes, Casanova, RBX, etc. These are very light, strong strap helps to keep your wrist very stable. Gloves are light so that helps to keep your guard up (no excuses). Yes, it's an expensive product but good value for money if you're pro or semi-pro. Amateurs or beginners probably should look for cheaper Hayabusa products or go with RBX. If you're pro/ semi-pro you will like this product using on the bag keeping your wrist and hands protected. I recommend that so far.

I think understanding the reviewer adds value to the review.I have been training almost 6 years and started with an off the shelf 30$ pair of gloves. Typical gonna give this a try glove.My gym is a hybred, more than a fitness club but not a hard core fighters gym.Perfect for some hard bag workout with some light sparring sprinkled in.Gradually stepped up my glove, wore out a pair of Titles.I recently upped my trainingTo 4 days and the Ringside pair I had was nice but just did not offer the wrist support I needed, plus they ran small and I had a hard time getting wraps in.Spent a little more money on this pair 16 oz. 1 week in..... I could definitely feel a quality upgrade from what I had. The wrist support was very good. My hands have enough room for wraps, but do not feel like I ""have"" to have them.Double Velcro was not overly hard to figure out.I see little difference in the ""Engineered"" leather.That was a concern.You can easily get a pair of leather gloves for that much money. I was hesitant to buy a pair without trying them on.The price was a little on the high side of the spectrum for me, but so far worth it. I don't have to pull some punches for fear of sore wrist, makes training a bit more fun.This glove is as advertised."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716428

Great gloves.|I read a ton of different reviews and tried on several different types of gloves when I was looking for a new pair of boxing gloves. I was primarily looking for good quality, durable heavy bag workout gloves. I tried on some gloves from Rival, but these by far felt the best. As soon as I put them on they felt very comfortable, my fist was in a very natural position, and they felt pretty broken in right from the start. The sweat wipe on the thumb is icing on the cake, not many gloves offer that. The wrist support is fantastic on these. Yes the double wrist lock takes a little getting used to, but honestly after 2 - 3 times I was already used to it and it's not issue. If you're looking for a mid-level boxing glove I would say it's worth spending the extra money to get the higher quality like these T3's. They feel great and seem very durable, I would definitely recommend these.For reference, I'm 5 ft. 9, 145 lbs. I first tried the 16 oz but those seemed a little too heavy for what I wanted to do, so I exchanged for the 14 oz and those feel perfect.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716436

These gloves are extremely comfortable once broken in and it doesn’t take to awful long to get there. The only thing I’ll say is that they claim that these gloves provide some additional wrist support in and of themselves. While this could be true I have not noticed a remarkable difference between these gloves and any other in that way. The suede thumb portion is AWESOME for absorbing sweat from the brow line while hitting mits or sparring etc. In all the gloves are just a little pricy in my opinion but they are pretty nice.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716464

For people who struggle at keeping their shoulders loose, I find these gloves have their weight well distributed and slightly heavier on the fingers which forces my shoulders to relax. Similar to the Title Blacks in build and feel, I highly recommend these for sparring and bags. The wrist support is epic (yes, it’s two Velcros but it’s rather manageable—I just use my teeth to grab and tighten the inner one.Make sure to clean and dry these well. Don’t use and forget to care for them. They are 100% worth every penny, but your equipment will only be as good as you keep it. I work out 3-4 times a week with heavy bag and sparring work.

Highly recommended.|As this is the 4th pair of gloves in general I've purchased, so I'm no expert,but I definitely know what quality feels like. Iwould have to say the T3s are very good quality gloves for the price,BUT they are a casual glove,not on the level as winning or some everlast.,I feel they focused on looks and feels rather than durability and performance I would rate them as suchComfort:8I give this an 8 because they are very comfortable and form fitting but with wraps on I find it hard to make an actual fistLooks:10 they look absolutely amazing,non bulky,good leather and an AMAZING sound if you are a power puncher like meDurability: 6this is where the T3s are lacking,after only 5, 2-hour sessions the seam was coming undone and the Velcro strip seemed to be fraying rapidly,I punch quite hard,and throw around 2k punches a session so,that may contribute.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716483

Why would they base glove size on height and weight when it has little to do with hand size??I'm 5'7"" and around 165lbs. According to Hayabusa, I should be 12oz which is great. I like light gloves for heavy bag and mitt workout even though I hit hard. I've used a lot of different Title gloves and find them to be bulky. My favorites are Rivals, the RB10's and now the D30's. So I was hoping for a nice, Rival-like, fast, light glove. Despite the size chart, my gut told me 12oz would be too small (my hand measures 8 3/4 inches around the knuckles), so played it safe and ordered the 14 oz. Just received them and I can just get my hand in without wraps. With wraps, they were so tight my circulation was gut off.Debating whether to return them for 16 oz or just return them and try something else. But Hayabusa - try making a size chart based on hand circumference, not height and weight!"|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716488

My only complain is they start to smell unlike my other gloves, even though I clean them. I got these gloves back in September and use them about 4 times a week. I’m a heavy hitter and found that with my old gloves my knuckles would be sore after training. When I wear these I can throw heavy punches without sacrificing my hands. Never really needed high wrist support but these gloves provide pretty good support for the wrists. Can do push-ups will wearing the gloves without a problem. Again my only complain is that they start to smell even though I use a glove cleaning spray once a week and put dryer sheets in them all the time. At first I thought it was my wraps but even with freshly washed wraps my hands smell absolutely horrible. I think it’s time to get actual glove deodorizer. Hopefully that will take care of the stench. My old gloves never had any odors and I never used any cleaning product on them. So I’ll have to see what else I can do. I was hoping they weren’t going to require much maintenance.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716520

Used them for bag work and they protected my hands well but definitely had a awkward feel on contact.I returned them after a few sessions.

I originally had some ~$50 everlast gloves, but didn't like the way they felt.These gloves feel great when hitting the heavy bag. Literally feels like pillows are on my hands.One downside that I've seen in some reviews are that the gloves are too tight.I do think that they come tight, but for me, they have stretched out to a comfortable level while wearing wraps.As of yet, I don't see any downside to buying these gloves, I am also not very picky so perhaps that has swayed my opinion.

Paired with a charcoal deodorizer, they will not stink and last an incredibly long time. Been using them multiple times weekly and they're just ridiculously comfortable.I wouldn't recommend them for working a heavy bag--not that they're not up to it, they totally are--rather, they're best used with focus mitts or faces, haha. Thinner gloves are typically better for working the bag to strengthen wrists, and developed alignment and technique.----------I've had these gloves for about a month now, so not long enough to really get a feel for their durability over time.I can say that they're ridiculously intuitive in terms of my comfort and it only took me about 6hours of use (3x weekly) to get used to them from the large 16oz vinyl hayabusa I was coming from. My hands got much sweatier at first due to the leather and lack of ventilation, but as my sweat loosened the gloves up (with the extra air holes for flow) and they molded to me and my style a little more, it became more and more comfortable to wear.I would definitely recommend these and will update this later with a description on their durability.- A self-defense based boxer/kickboxer/clinch fighter.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716643

TREAT YO HANDS.|These gloves are the real deal.I used Everlast gloves for the past 10 years or so, on and off, doing some bag and pad work. As soon as you feel and see the T3 Hayabusas, you know you're dealing with a whole 'notha animal.The exterior of the glove is beautiful. It's clearly crafted with care and attention to detail.When you put them on, the interior is soft and textured, really giving you the feeling that these are something of value, which they are.The padding is great in the 14 oz, not overboard, which some 14's can be, but you're supported during long workouts. I box with handwraps, and as with all new gloves getting my hands in with the wraps took a little extra during my 1st and 2nd sessions of padwork. By now (2 weeks later), my hands fit in nicely, with a supported snug fit.The knuckles are well supported, especially with wraps, and there is decent breathability, though I don't have the sweatiest hands.These are glorious gloves, and definitely worth getting.

They were either too soft, too rigid, cuff length too long, you name it. I decided to spend the extra money on these as nothing else had worked out. For starters it’s a beautifully designed glove. It just looks amazing. The double wrist strap provides great support and it’s very comfortable to wear. They feel broken in already. Nice and firm over the knuckles, but also able to open and close my fist. The microfiber thumb for wiping sweat is the icing on the cake.

The hand compartment is pretty much the same with all the different oz gloves, with the only difference being the thickness or bulky ness of the glove. Meaning the way my hand fitted inside the 10 oz was roughly the same as how it fitted in the 14 oz gloves. I'm 5'4 and 128 lbs. I got the 10 oz but realized the padding was a little too small for me. I decided to get the 14 oz, but then realize these gloves feel fairly light even for me. So I'm exhanging these to get the 16 oz once Hayabusa contacts me. Great glove, tight and secure. Basically if you can take your thumb and ring finger and wrap it around your other wrist, chances are you smaller wrist circumference would benefit from this brand of glove. Feels solid in the hand and looks cool too. Smaller hands looking for a glove? This could be a potential option.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716750

user|R1RX5RE6F14V5Y|B07S323CF4||Allan Elvir|5|February 26, 2018|1519610400|Great pair of gloves for intermediate to advanced boxers|"So far, I have tried boxing gloves from the brands Fortis, Everlast, Venum and lastly Hayabusa, in that order, and in my opinion, they have been pretty decent upgrades in said order.I was a little bit reluctant to try these Hayabusa gloves, since they are essentially an MMA brand, what I practice is pure boxing. Most of my workouts being the heavybag (12 - 16 rounds a day), double end bag (3 - 6 rounds like every two days)and the mitt work with the coach, that's the work for which I use the gloves anyways.I bought the 12Oz gloves to practice with a little bit more of speed than strength in my punches, that being said to put you in context, now here goes the review.First, if you read other reviews, you will find out that the gloves have this snug feel that for the first time user to Hayabusa could feel weird and uncomfortable, thing is, in my experience, the gloves do have to be ""broken in"" to make them feel right in your hands, the firs time I used the gloves, I even had some hand pain after extended sessions on the heavy bag, but that was just for like 3 days into using them, after a while, the gloves start to feel great in your hands, they give you this snug feeling that I didn't feel with any of the other brands I have tried.Also, the whrist support is amazing, to the point where it might help you fix some of the bad habits one can develop when training, like not aligning your wrist, elbow and shoulders for the hooks and uppercuts. This is always welcome, for it avoids nasty injuries and keeps your hands safe in every workout.These gloves' inner structure for absorbing the impact, is made of hi tech foam, as stated by the manufacturer, this is one of the best features of the glove since they absorb pretty good all impacts consistently, and without sacrificing speed, in fact, because the momentum of the punch is so well absorbed, it helps you set up follow up punches a little bit faster, at leat in my opinion.The inside of the glove is made of an absorbent fabric which has antimicrobial properties and thermoregulating capacities, I remember the first time I put the gloves on, thinking that the fabric was very thick, which made me think that it could get really hot when training, but to my surprise, the gloves keep quite cool even after 12 rounds of usage.Finally, the ""X"" Closure system, which adds an extra velcro pad that closes on top of the normal one. Now, I'm not a fan of this feature, the additional velcro, tends to stick to your hand wraps, making it really hard to put the gloves on by yourself, this being said, I keep my review a 5 star review, cause I do think that even when this is an annoying feature to deal with when putting the gloves on, I also think that this system is part of the reasons why these gloves have such an amazing whrist support.Summarizing, these pair of gloves are awesome, I would highly recommend this pair of gloves to an intermediate to advanced boxer, the beginner not so much since there are tons of other options that are less expensive and can do the trick at least for the time when you are more focused on the basic stuff"|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716759

I wore then for about 6 months, twice a week for training. My knuckles were still hurting and frequently getting cuts on them. I thought that was normal. Then I lost one glove and had to buy a replacement. I bought Hayabusa 4oz MMA gloves which are more pricey but I wanted to try something different. Holy moly, the new gloves feel wonderful. Are easier to put on, my hands hurt less and I can comfortably spend an hour on a heavy bag. The knuckle protection on these sucks, wrist support is weak.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716794

I do this for my cardio days because it is a lot more fun than running for 40 minutes. Plus it helps me release stress and relax afterwards. The pinky on both hands are rubbed not sure if that is my tender little digits or the gloves. We will revisit. As for comfort, not at all for me, but again I am not a pro so I can't speak much to that. But after one 30 minute use, I already have stitch strings starting to hang, so we shall see how long they hold up. I am not expecting too long with strings already hanging off.

They’ve been through a lot, here’s my review:Most important to me, they’re surprisingly durable: the padding is not worn down much, and other than the superficial damage you see in the picture from occasional scraping on the bag, they work as well as the first day. Depending on how hard you strike you may get some occasional knuckle bruising, but if thats a concern you can wear them with a wrap. Speaking of, I wear these without any other wraps/supports and have found the wrist support to be just fine without them.However, they are pretty cheap gloves so don’t have pro level construction. If you’re going hard on a heavy bag, especially if you’re new to boxing, your hands WILL get roughed up. This includes your knuckles, fingers where the edge of the gloves touches your hands, and even in between knuckle joints. To some extent this will happen with any gloves, but especially noticeable with these. As some other reviews have mentioned they seem to run a little large, which exacerbates the problem — unless you have big hands, I’d avoid the L/XL. (I’m 5’10, 175 and the L/XL are workable but definitely a little too large.)Overall if you’re looking for a lighter, less padded option instead of full boxing gloves, these are a solid option that will last you a long time and be easy on the budget. But expect some discomfort as you break them and your hands in.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.716979

I would normally wear a large so I went with the sm/med and so far no rubbing, not even above the first knuckle where most of the reviews stated. If you can't size down, I'm not sure what to tell you. Padding is good. I'm not a professional so me slugging away at heavy bags don't bother me. The wrist straps are long and secure but are too rigid to wear during conditioning exercises where you may need wrist movement. All in all great product.

user|R1DIH0TY8JZ2S9|B07TT16B18|B07TT16B18|Nick|4|August 4, 2021|1628042400|Good for beginners|If you're a beginner in the world of fighting/ heavy bag workout then these will work fine. You're knuckles are going to get bruised or cut until they toughen up. This is normal and expected since the skin there isn't typically accustomed to the abuse it'll take when learning to punch. Use wraps if you don't want/ can't handle the discomfort of injured knuckles.The wraps around the wrist are rigid and sturdy and protect fairly well from tweaking your wrist on impact. Again, use wraps if you need more protection.4/5 simply because the gloves don't really fit well. I got the smallest size even though I have fairly large hands and they still move, rub, and need to be readjusted often. Only order the larger size if you have truly massive hands, otherwise you'll be rubbing the skin off your knuckles with every punch.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.717163

The gloves are confortable to wear, the air hole design in the palm is also very reasonable, the material of fist cover is thicker.

I go with an 18oz option.I always found that these gloves do fit with wraps pretty well and the foam/padding adjusted to my hands rather quickly. Go a size down if your hands are smaller. I had little to no break in time. It is hard to find gloves that just work for you. As a bag glove I prefer this. I have expensive gloves but come back to these. I like the larger sizes they offer. Not every manufacturer offers 18+oz. I feel like I am connecting and getting the response I am typically looking for. The sound they make and the feedback I receive are what like compared to some other gloves I own. I do however supplement the wrist wrap with more support from my wraps. For 31+ bucks you have to make some trade offs. Overall I recommend for beginners bag work. Just know your body, practice proper punching technique and always wrap correctly to prevent injury.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.717650

They are used by multiple people of various abilities, and they are going on 3 years old now. I'm impressed with how well they've held up! They naturally have become smelly after repeated use in a hot, humid climate, but have withstood daily spraydowns of disinfectant and repeated use.

Iused these for power-focused heavy bag work and work on thai pads/focus mitts 3-4 days a week, to help add a little more speed and power to my punches when I switch to 16oz for sparring.This was a LOT of punishment for them, ha. Some of the stitching came loose after about a month, but a bit of duct tape fixed it no problem, then some more serious deterioration started happening after about five months.Finally after six months Icould feel the padding coming to pieces inside the glove, and the seams around the wrist started going.And to reiterate, these are not complaints, just outlining the life of my gloves!IMPORTANT TO NOTE: the heavier weight gloves are not ""true"" 18oz/20oz etc, these simply feEL like 16oz gloves with some added weight at the front/fingers, and in the wrist.Which is fine for bag/pad work, but a big no for any kind of contact work with a partner."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.717688

I’ve stopped getting bruises and actually have better technique because I kept preventing myself from looping my punches due to the weight.

I wanted something with a lot more padding so I could hit the bag as hard as I wanted without hurting my hands. Most online forums suggested a 16oz glove so I got the 18oz just to be safe and they are great! The velcro straps allow me to put them on by myself, and the padding is so thick I cant even feel the bag against my knuckle when I hit it. The wrist is also very sell supported and has a outer layer of padding that prevents your wrist from snapping back when hitting hard. Definitely a good find.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.717863

Right out of the box (I should say bag), these gloves had that ""broken in feel"". Incredibly comfortable. I'm 5'10"", 195lbs, and these gloves accommodated my hands, with 180"" wraps, as if they were custom fitted.The material was very dense, so I would not use them for sparring. But then again, they're 20oz gloves. Not a lot of material around the wrists was very nice, compared to some of the other gloves that make you feel like you're in a cast up to your elbow.So far, I've put about 100 rounds of heavy (and I do mean heavy) bag work on these gloves, and the foam does not feel ""punched out"" at all, but I did notice a very small tear in the stitching near the thumb of one glove. Does not interfere with the performance at all.I will definitely order these again, once I punch this pair out. IF I ever punch them out."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.717917

I don't think you will be dissatisfied with them. I definitely recommend."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.717956

I have a really good pair I prefer to wear to my boxing classes, but sometimes I want to leave those at home since they're bigger and tougher to put in my backpack. I also wear those so much that I want to air them out every 2-3 sessions so they don't get stinky. So I bought this pair since they're light, smaller than my other gloves. They're really well ventilated so I haven't had an issue with smell or sweat. I wouldn't recommend these if you're gunna hardcore beat up a bag, because they're not really cushioned as well as other gloves. I also thought that the velcro straps were too long, so putting these on/taking them off, is tough unless you have someone to help you.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.717994

Right around the 1 year mark, I noticed several tears along the seams on both gloves, about 5 total. I would say these are good for a novice boxer or if you are still trying out classes, but if you know you will be using these long term, I would recommend spending the extra $20 or so and getting a higher quality pair.

Dancer|4|August 29, 2016|1472436000|Good price for a good glove.|I purchased this glove for a student for a kickboxing class, and the glove is in great condition, and more than meets the needs for the class.The price is good, better than I have seen for most gloves of this quality, but not the best.Pros:The gloves is well padded for not only bag and mitt work but for light to moderate sparring.The material is a synthetic leather that I have seen in past purchases held up nicely to daily training.Excellent room for both standard cotton hand wraps, quick wraps and tape and gauze wrapping.Cons:Wrist strap is small and thin, making it hard to get glove on and off without helpSingle stitching along the thumb line where most rips occur.Overall;Very good glove for the money and would recommend to anyone taking a beginners or cardio based boxing/kickboxing class but not for someone looking for a longer term or heavy training glove. Once you start hitting hard or doing more advanced drills I don't believe this glove will do the job.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.718132

I am 6'6, 230 lbs, and just want to do some aerobox and such to keep in shape and burn down some calories without using the nasty gloves they have available for everyone at the gym. Didn't want to pay a lot for new ones though, so I went with these.They are comfortable, fit perfectly, the pad protects my hands and knuckles, and most of all, they are way cheaper than any other gloves I've seen so far.Highly recommended!|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.718394

I liked the idea of pink boxing gloves - easy to keep track of, won't get confused with others, and they'd be cute - but I was nervous abt the actual color. In person, the pink is more of a pearlized pink, much more understated than I was expected. They are whimsical without being too girly. Additionally, it's surprisingly hard to find 14 oz boxing gloves for women. I could have downsized to 12 oz but If I had it would have been a bit cramped.

I'm in the gym 4 - 5 days a week using them and they are holding up great. The only thing is, they make my hands sweat because the palms are not ventilated as well as more expensive pairs.

Look when you train at least 3 times a week, you go through quite a few pairs a year. It's not that the gloves rip or anything. The smell inside eventually makes them trash. Even the most breathable gloves succumb to the smell eventually. These are good leather gloves and can stand impact of heavy bags for days and months. I got these for mitt work so they last a bit longer. They are low cost too so doesn't feel bad if you have to get a new pair. That's one reason I don't spend a lot on gloves.

The velcro at the bottom wraps perfectly around my wrist and they feel secure on my hands. Secondly, I like that they're really padded, I don't feel the impact when punching the bag. They have areas where air can get to your hands so they won't sweat or get too hot. I really wanted the pink gloves, but only the white was available. However, I like the white ones. They look great and got some compliments at the gym.Overall, I really like these boxing gloves! They fit wonderfully, look great, and protect my hands. These gloves come with a storage bag that you can easily carry on your back or holding the straps. I love the positive affirmation on the front of the bag. It's motivation to keep going!

There's a large wrap around velcro band that let's you tighten to your hand size and easy on-off.I don't know I would classify this as for Ladies. From big kid to smaller hand adults, male or female, doesn't make a difference. You won't go wrong in size in a large spectrum of fit.

They fit snug around my wrist which provides extra support, but the gloves are big. I purchased these not knowing they were a size 16oz. The smallest size is 8oz, and in this color they only had 16oz available. So I’ve had to buy another smaller pair in the gray and black. I will keep these for others who may train with me with bigger hands, and I love the red and black color, but unfortunately I’ll have to settle for the gray and black due to the misinformation. Still a nice glove though, just wish I’d received a smaller size in this color.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.718790

A good quality glove for the money, and I’ve tried several in this price range over the last 5 years.One cool thing is when I do a back fist or knife hit on the bag they are extremely loud and motivational! Everyone in my kickboxing class is looking over and saying they don’t want to get in a knife fight with me.My only complaint is these gloves are more challenging to put on due to the wrist strap mechanism.It takes a while getting the second glove on and if you need to take them off/on multiple times during a workout, it really slows you down.

Upon opening the package I immediately noticed that they looked small. I ordered the 16 oz (gloves say they're 16) and these feel like 12s or 14s. I'll use them for bagwork but will not attempt to use them for sparring, I'm 200+ and I might accidentally hurt someone. The padding on the knuckles is ok, but the outer fist feels a little solid. Also, it's a really tight squeeze once the hands are wrapped.If you want gloves that look cool and you aren't planning on punching anybody, these will suffice.

All in all compared to more expensive gloves, these are very comfortable. I notice with the natural leather (like Hayabusa), my hands seem to get a little hot inside of these compared to other gloves that use synthetic leather. The lining inside feels nice on your hands and is nice and tight (hate when it gets bunchy).

At 16 oz they're a bit heavier than many like for bag work, but I prefer the extra weight. I can't know how long they'll last, as they're some sort of synthetic ""leather,"" but appear as study and well made as my old competition gloves. And, they're very comfortable and well-fitting. I'd prefer a slightly larger grip strip since I no longer tape my hands (since it's just for bag work), but that's a nit in the greater scheme of things (and if you use tape you'll be fine). Their aesthetic is actually nicer than the photo in real life too. All-in-all I'm glad I got them."|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.719132

I feel like its actually a steal for those with average to small hands for most uses (except sparring, which the material seems a bit too stiff for)Having abnormally long fingers makes the thumb and finger grip areas of the glove a concern for me.On the plus side, the straps are great and the gloves seem to stay snug (maybe because of the hand size?) Throughout prolonged use on pads / bag. If you need a cheap training glove, but don't want to buy the big name brand that's at most major sports stores, give these a good look. Venum is a major brand I have the exact same issues with, but I'd argue FIGHTR is comparable quality to their cheaper options.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.719176

Having heard and read many positive to glowing comments on Fairtex gloves, I got these in 16-ounce for more protection for myself and if and when I get practice partners. At inspection they look spectacularly well made: you'll see right away why people like them. They also feel like they'll last forever: I found exactly no flaws, and they feel sturdy as can be. But for me the comfort isn't so good: I've got sore thumbs from the first use and every time since, whether or not I use hand wraps, and the padding on the striking surface feels very thin and causes knuckle pain (less with the wraps on). Maybe these are what real boxers (i.e., not someone like me who is just looking for good, whole-body exercise) call a ""puncher's glove"": I'd worry a bit about actually striking someone with them, though. I'd also like to see some air holes on the palm to match those on the thumb to vent some heat. The amazon listing lumps a number of different models together, and you can loop through the size and color options (many and impressive), but not every model appears in every color, and I didn't actually know I'd ordered the BGV14 until I got it and compared it with others reviewed online (the glove itself doesn't have the model number on or in it). Others who got the 14s have made the same comments I'm making here. I admit to looking for the less expensive options and buying one of them partly because of price (prices of the various models and colors can vary by more than $50 US). So I'd caution the buyer to try to determine exactly the model you'll be getting and make sure it's likely to be the best fit for you. You may find this model a perfect fit, but I'll need to try to break mine in slowly and carefully."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.719363
user|R3NJKNE5BNSZSA|B077QV8VQ6||Ricky hernandez|5|May 20, 2021|1621476000|My favorite Fairtex Gloves so far!|I have been training in Muay Thai for 6 years and I'm a collector of gloves. I collect, compare, review and sell gloves.I purchased the all white BGV14 skyntex gloves in 16oz.These gloves have exceeded my expectations.I had originally purchased a pair of BGV9s but something happened during transport and they never made it to my house.I had read that some were comparing these BGV14s to the BGV9s, just as a synthetic version. I wanted a Mexican style gloves without the price of a Mexican glove(Cleto Reyes, Gil, Etc.).These gloves delivered! They have a double layer of latex foam padding that POP on the bag/mitts and will last 100s of rounds. Great hand compartment, especially compared to the BGV1. The hand compartment have enough space to have a solid wrap without feeling too snug. Easy to open and close my fist to catch/parry. The synthetic leather(microfibre/skyntex) has been holding up well and I don't see any sign of wear. I don't use these to spar nor would I recommend it. The padding being latex foam, gives it a pretty stiff feel. I wouldn't feel comfortable hitting my sparring partners with these, but to each their own.Overall a great pair of gloves and a steal for the price!I've seen people say that they are fake gloves and that caused them to hurt their hands. Honestly, I would say that these are an intermediate/advanced glove for those who have conditioned hands and know how to throw. If you're a beginner be aware that these are STIFF.Train hard and train smart!|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.719365

The gloves have decent stitching, and feel comfortable, but don’t really provide adequate protection for bigger folks or harder hitters. The padding feels oddly soft , but not very protective. I use them essentially as bag gloves after a few sparring partners mentioned feeling knuckles through the pad, kinda a no-no in training etiquette. All in all, cheaply made gloves, a bit over priced, but probably adequate for folks looking for just for a bag /fitness glove.

Makes it easier to get my punches through when I'm sparring with my Muay Thai partners.The olive green also just give them a coolness factor that other gloves don't have.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.719413

user|R10OKPJ1EOT82D|B077QV8VQ6|B00NB2GI3M|Randy|4|February 24, 2020|1582509600|Tight with hand wraps|I bought the Military green F-Day BGV11. I understand these gloves have a tight fit design, but with handwraps, it gets uncomfortable quick. It put a lot of pressure and added discomfort while doing bag work. I'm hoping this will change as the gloves break-in and I will give an updated review.The Pros:These Muay Thai gloves offer plenty of padding on the wrist and back of the thumbs. There are 7 air-vents (3 along the thumbs, and 4 on the palm) that allows your hands to breathe well. The syntex leather feels like quality material; not as good as leather, but almost on par for those who prefer to take a more ethical route. The finger well sits deep in the gloves, giving you the feeling of more control and a better grip. It offers 2 grip bars; palm and fingers. These gloves have a slimmer design that doesn't feel cumbersome or bulky on your hands.The Cons:My only complaint is the tight fit. I already stated that I hope, overtime, these gloves will break-in more. Currently, with handwraps, there's pressure on the back of the thumbs and edge of the palm by the pinky finger. Hopefully, as the material loosens up, it will alleviate this pressure. They feel great without hand wraps but will obviously cause your hands to sweat a lot more.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.719432

However, I wanted to try this as it was limited...but I was very disappointed by it. Very poorly designed, and you don’t get much support on your wrist area as they used very soft material to build around that area. I gave two star for the look of it.

I train a lot , I mean I get off my full time , go home , get geared up and go train. Train about 6 times a week and... let me say that these gloves hurt my knuckles the very first day. I don't know if my knuckles are used to Winnings or Reyes but they def hurt. Used it last night , still hurt. I wrap my hands mexican style , with the longest wraps and double cushion , still hurt my hands. There is a big amount of room you have when you stick your hand in and I don't think thats good IMO. It needs to be tight and fit so your knuckles can absorb the same amount , but my hands are moving all over the place in these gloves. Still deciding if I want to return these and get myself Twins or the new OnX gloves. Invest $20 more or $180? But Winning beats all.EDIT : Ok I thought it needed to be broken in but the thumb area.. is huge. It doesn't even feel like my thumb is in the glove since there is so much space.

The first two are the BGV5 models which I want to comment on first.The 16oz Red BGV5 was purchased in Sept 2015The 16oz Black BGV5 was purchased in Oct 2016.The 16oz Black and Yellow BGV14Y were purchased Feb 2017.-The first pair was used for sparring, pads and bag work for a year, 5 times a week on average. I used some miso bags to help keep them from getting gross inside over this time. Another year with these gloves and they now started showing some cracking/opening around the wrist. The wrist support was/is great and the hand room has enough space to not feel restricted and not enough to feel it floating around.-The second pair was purchased to replace the first for sparring. They seemed lighter/smaller but hand to hand, I could never tell. I figured the padding just expanded over time on the first one. 6 months later, they're still great sparring. Similar to the first pair, the wrist support is solid, seems to be a bit more hand room in this one but again, not enough for it to swim around.I'll break here and say the most recent pair is what caused me to do the side by side and weigh using a food scale.The BGV1s, despite the size difference, weight exactly the same, just a little over 18oz. I wish I weighed this at time of purchase to see if it changed over time. Yes, they were weighed while dry not been used for almost two days.The BGV14Y, the apparent longest of the three, weighed a little over 14oz, despite being having 16oz printed on the wrist strap. I bought these for sparring but given the lighter weight, I'm just decommissioning the red BGV1s and using these for pads and bags.-The most recent pair, are very simliar as far as wrist support, maybe just a bit more. However, the hand room is much smaller. Ironically for me, these would be great for clinch work if they actually weighed what they say. I still need to break them in more but so far they have been great for the bag.I would give the BGV14Y5 stars if they at least weighed what they're advertised as.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.719756

I use these 2-5x a week for about an hour and the only thing I would have done different, was get one of those glove deodorizers. I love the OD green look and would buy another pair without thinking. I know a couple people who went the cheaper route and have issues with their gloves breaking down. If it wasn't for the odor and 1 scratch on the gloves, you would never know they were not new. Everyone in my academy has had the same result with Fairtex products. If you are serious about striking, these are the way to go. Just do not get them if you need to grip anything. They do well for clenching but that's it.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.719773

I have always wanted to use 16oz. I didnt want a huge glove either. This size is perfect, its not huge, even smaller than my 14oz topking. But i think my hands are a bit small for 16oz. There were some space but once i wrapped my hands it was good to go.The weight distribution is top notch. i can actually feel the difference when i throw kicks. I have been using top king super air gold star, i can feel my hands flailing out and down because most of the weight is in the front of the gloves. With fairtex bgv11 i can keep my hand up much easier when i throw kicks.i dont like bring my kicking side hand all the way down when I kick. I keep it straight. These gloves makes it a lot easier.Even though its synthetic leather, the pop and hit feel the same as real leather. Love that sound and i can also feel the hit despite i was using 16oz.I personally like gloves with longer cuffs to protect my wrist, bgv11 got a really long cuff but your wrists can still move pretty comfortably around, great for clinching. And the velcro is so perfect, you can make it tight and the velcro tab still wont stick out and scratch people. Very sturdy too, Great design.I got the optical art, looks freaking awesome, gotten quite a few compilments and my gloves stand out from the crowd.Shipping was fast. Three business days straight outta thailand. Thanks imaggie. Came with the box too, i almost cried when I saw that it came with the box... didnt expect it and super stoked.I had two real leather gloves and they fall apart pretty fast. But i have had some cheap everlast gloves with synthetic leather that lasted me for at least three years with almost no damage except the palm mesh was balling up a bit.

They haven't broken or anything, they just are very clearly not high quality.

I have narrow wrists, and there is absolutely no support for them -- the tighter available mode still lets my wrist float inside. As a beginner at home, these are doing the job, but I expect I'll need some lace-up ones if I end up getting into the sport. It's likely that someone with stronger wrists will get the necessary support from the stiff velcro closure.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.720187

So unless they start falling apart a year from now from using them a few times a week, these are a great deal in my opinion.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.720635

First session they were so snug & comfy I didn’t even use hand wraps. If you ask me these are more comfy than Everlast but as far as durability... I haven’t had them for that long. 10/10 so far.

That stated, I was going to splurge and get some Hyabusas until a buddy of mine bought a pair of these in blue. For under $35 these gloves can't be beat. Very strong gel inside and as stiff as my old Venoms. However, the interior is VERY SMALL.I'm 5'9 and 155lbs and even buying 14oz gloves, my little baby Trump hands had difficulty slipping em on with wraps. Once inside though, they're great. Plenty of thumb room and the breath strip in the middle keeps my hands cooler than before, even if only a little bit. Best of all, they have em in a variety of colors. I got the Lomachenko yellow ones and they look awesome and much more expensive than they actually are. Winning.Will do a 6 month update for durability but for now, these are fantastic boxing/sparring gloves, so long as you don't have Shaq hands.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.721132

user|R9WYQXPIINGHD|B07J4LPML4|B07RQCQ1X1|Chase|3|September 21, 2020|1600653600|In the end, they are $30 gloves|Hello fellow Amazon review reader.Much like you I scour through the reviews of products I plan on buying, especially if the product is from a company I have never purchased from before, which is most of what I buy from Amazon.For the short version of this review, you are buying a glove that feels like it's $30.If you don't know what that means, you're probably on your first pair of gloves so these will probably be just fine for you, for now.If you are just looking to save some cash and have been hitting things for at least a little bit, I suggest you keep searching.I am not a professional fighter.I have only trained in stand-up fighting techniques sparingly and have sparred very few times in my life so I am writing this as a purely recreational fight enthusiast who uses these gloves on a freestanding bag while working ground-and-pound on a Thai bag my wife wouldn't let me hang in the new house, thus the freestanding.I started on Everlast gloves way back in 2011 and have owned at least three different pairs of Everlasts.I then moved on to Title since I tried one of their gloves and it felt better than the Everlast so I then owned two or three pairs of those.I had a pair of $70 Title Platinum gloves that lasted me until they pretty much felt like I had no gloves on at all.But what do I do, plunk down another $60-100 on gloves, again I'm not a pro, or try out good old Amazon, see if I can find a bargain pair.This is the bargain pair I settled on, $30 - worth a shot right?For a freestanding bag, sure, these will work just fine....but it depends on what hand you're talking about.The right glove feels not too much different than my old Title glove - snug, comfy, padded enough (16 oz) in the right places, and I can use a handwrap no problem, still feel it a bit when I throw 100% but not enough that it feels like I have no glove, an acceptable $30 glove.The left.....not so much.The left feels like it's being held together inside by cardboard and the padding is much less than the right.Hence, when I hit the bag I wrap my right hand but use a speed wrap with gel padded knuckles on the left...just for that little bit of extra protection since I feel it way more with my left due to the lack of padding.On the freestanding bag this lack of padding isn't a really big deal but on my banana bag when I work the ground I feel it much more...just some food for thought.I also didn't feel it was a big enough deal to warrant contacting the seller since, best case scenario right, they send me a new pair where both gloves feel like the right.But then what I do with the old pair?Toss them?Send them back?Nah...I'll just wear these out, compared to my old Titles I don't think it's going to take nearly as long although it did take at least a few sessions to really wear these in so, who knows, maybe their durability will surprise me.If you're a cardio (kick)boxer then these will, more than likely, do just fine.If you're not someone who throws 100% at any point of time during training then these will do just fine.If you're going to primarily use these for sparring and not heavy bag work then these will do just fine.If you're going to primarily use these to lay waste to a heavy bag and throw punches like that bag insulted yo momma, then I'd suggest biting the bullet and upgrading.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.721142

These gloves have a really good fit and provide the perfect level of feedback after a strike. The right-hand glove had a broken stitch out of the box. I found a contact # and email address online for the company and called one afternoon to report the issue. The guy that answered was so helpful and went above and beyond to correct the issue. I found out later that it was the National Sales Director's cellphone number that I had contacted and that it was 2am local time for him when I called. I still can't believe how helpful and polite the guy was after being woken up at 2am with a customer service issue and stayed with me until the issue was corrected. ZTTY sent me a new pair of gloves and they have been great. I'm really pleased with how well the gloves hold their shape after thousands of strikes.I would recommend this product to anyone!In fact, after they sent the new pair, I bought a 2nd pair of gloves so that I would have an extra set for sparring partners.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.721188

So far, they've held up really well to some tough sessions. Of course, I'm a small female, so my max punching power is probably 50% of most reasonably fit/trained boxers - so take this review with a grain of salt and don't blame me if you punch through these in a month!Anyway, they're great training gloves. Not too heavy, but weighty enough to get a great workout in and fatigue your arms.

These glove are a decent training bag glove and I would highly recommend a second pair of gloves for sparing. The Everlast elite pro are designed for a small body frame. The padding that wraps around your forearm are a nice concept for blocking punches but not realistic in a real boxing match. For a larger body frame, I would continue my search for a more fitting glove. I'm giving these glove a decent review because they are actually decent gloves for training, the only bad part of these glove are wrapping the velcrow around your forearm, especially if you have a built forearm.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.721487

While punching things with these on, I felt nothing. The strap provides great strength for holding the gloves on. From a beginners view, buy these. If you have ever touched gloves running for about $200 dollars and up, these feel like that. I thought they would be bad because of such a low price, but they are actually great. There is 1 PROBLEM though; comfort. These gloves always feel slightly weird when on your hand, a little to tight no matter how you adjust the strap. But it is not so bad that it will mess you up when boxing. There is a mesh covering where your fingers start, which allows you to cool off. These gloves feel like the brand, Venum. So yes, I would recommend purchasing these no matter how old you are or what skill level you have.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.721878
user|R3W257ZDWOV9EW|B08MWQYWGG|B08MXNKKMC|Joanne Taroco |5|February 25, 2023|1677290400|Good wrist support|I bought a pair of everlast gloves from dicks and they were falling apart in less than three months. So I replaced them with this brand.I can tell you I was pleasantly surprised with how comfortable these gloves were. They have nice padding and support guards in the wrist. I was not aware of the support guards when I purchased the gloves so this was an added bonus. They are easy to put in and off, and because they are nicely padded I don't feel the kick back of thebag when boxing. I have not had any issues with the lining rippingwhich is why I had to replace my everlast gloves . I would recommend RDX brand over everlast everyday because of the comfort, the wrist support, shock absorbing of the padding and the ease of putting on and removing the RDX gloves during class.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.721881

So I bought him these boxing gloves so he could spar with me.I'd like to say I took it easy on him on account of the fact he's a little kid and my flesh and blood.Yeah, I'd like to say that.But when it got down to brass tacks, I gave him the business.

Been using for a couple of weeks now, 3 times a week. Wanted to invest in something more financially reasonable before going $100+ on gloves.Overall, I’ve enjoyed my purchase and my hands come away from class without any damage both in sparring and hanging bag work.These fit a bit snug with wraps on your hands but this may go away with time / breaking in the material.No flaking or loss of material after a few weeks. I sweat a ton and these are holding up and don’t smell off. Haven’t tried to truly clean them yet so time will tell.Would recommend for anyone who doesn’t want to drop $100+ without first using another product.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.722109

I called customer service and they were prompt to take care of the problem and sent me a new pair.I'm now concerned of having issues after long time use.

They feel like they're very well made and he says they're very comfortable. They are adjustable with a wide band of velcro so he can get them as snugly as he wants around his wrists. He's been punching away at his punching bag and the dog (in a playful way) all day. Overall, we absolutely recommend these boxing gloves and are happy to have them!|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.722504

I did not realize that the strap around the wrist was super long and had to be wrapped over and over. Kind of defeats the purpose of buying the glove over the traditional wrap. This one seems like a mix of the two. I like the RDX brand though. I return these and bought some different RDX ones with no strap that wraps around the wrist. They basically fit like a strong compression glove over your hand and you can wear them with ease inside of your gloves.

Maybe it's because they're cheap to purchase? I owned a pair for 7 months that I used twice a week for cross-fit, and they've since fallen apart. The decorative stitching around the fingers cuts off circulation to your fingers and makes them difficult to take off, and the stitching around your thumb leaves red pressure rings on your palm and also causes discomfort when wearing boxing gloves. Furthermore, the Velcro on mine began to come off as the stitching failed. Even the decorative stitching around the fingers and thumbs began to unravel. Last, but certainly most important, these provided zero protection to my knuckles. While the padding is sufficient for the backs of your hands, once on and snug they do nothing to protect your knuckles. I'd advise trying to find something better.

They allow you to hold punch mitts, kick shields, etc without having to get the gloves out. And they protect your hands very well, while allowing you to do other things. It's important to use a disinfectant wipe so it does not smell bad (that's not specific to this product, ANY glove you wear will need this type of care). These ones you can also wash in the washer (delicate cycle). I've been doing that and it helps keep it smell-free.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.722687

One design flaw.|Note: I got these for fast wrap protection on speed bag/double end bag. I'd never use anything but professional 180+ inch hand wraps and full size gloves on a heavy bag.These are easy on, easy off and offer enough protection and secure fit for how I use them. The padding doesn't extend far enough out to sufficiently protect the knuckles on the hands of both me and my training partner, just FYI. Hard to design this type of glove that offers that because the finger portion of the fabric doesn't extend far enough along to sew the pad to it. So for $15 bucks these are adequate.

At first, I thought the design of the glove was a bit...clunky, like someone just put a little bit of extra padding in a regular hand wrap. But when I actually used it a HUGE problem (at least for me) became apparent: it protects the upper, proximal knuckles just fine but middle knuckles are left exposed and are subject to injury. I cut open and bruised my right hand's index and middle proximal knuckles while working on the heavy bag. I would say order a different pair of gloves that provides a bit more protection and cover for your middle knuckles.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.722853

user|RJVB4BN784N7Q|B00PCIWX3W||Amazon Customer|2|November 29, 2020|1606615200|Bad fit for heavy hitters|For a heavyweight, these are underwhelming wraps. The majority of the material is cushioning for the back of the hand. And while that is certainly helpful for catching punches (and maybe doing a ton of MMA spinning back fists), it doesn't help with hitting much because there is no real compression. The stitching between fingers is uncomfortably thick and again provides no meaningful compression or support. The wrist wrap is both too short and cheaply made. They are slightly stretchy, offering some compression, but it's closer to a strip-mall sports store quality wrap than a respectable pro/am brand.They could be better for lighter weights, I suppose, but I'm not sure how. They are poorly engineered - more coverage for the same bad materials doesn't seem inherently better. My wrist and metacarpals don't feel meaningfully supported by the wrap when I hit, but the uncomfortable knotted stitches between my fingers sure are noticeable.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.723127

The only workout that I have done with these was hitting my speed bag and the stitching came apart that separates the middle and ring finger. When I buy something online the #1 thing that I look for is quality and durability, and these failed in that category. Now don't get me wrong, I can easily fix this by simply restitching the glove and it will most likely be way more durable compared to before. But I didnt spend $20+ dollars on an item to have to fix it 2 days later. So just for that, this item FAILS.Besides that, they wraps are comfortable and snug on my hand. But another caveat that I noticed was the padding on the knuckles slides up instead of staying in place and the whole idea of these wraps is to protect your knuckles, correct?Maybe I got a bad pair, or maybe I should have just purchased a similar item from a more reputable company.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.723137

They are well made and give me the support I need for Krav Maga. A very simple solution over wraps. Comfort is relative. Considering the reason for wearing them, yes they are comfortable and simple to put on and wear. The padding on the top of the hand makes it hard to wear MMA gloves. A “little padding” is only needed for the knuckles. Not the back of the hand. I’ll keep wearing them while looking for something that will fit better under my gloves.

Once I realized the rdx moves had more padding overall I came back to them and realized that I did not have to squeeze them too deep in my hands. I put them on and place them right before they fit the skin between my fingers. Perfect fit! Great support and padding! I feel like these have better padding all around than the everlast gel. Dont push them down completely to the inside of your fingers and they feel super comfortable and great protection with my 16 oz. Gloves and 150 pound bag.

My only concern is the logo stitched on the wrist. Because of the plastic logo it makes it difficult for me to use it in sparring since it’s a cutting hazard to my opponent. Once you cover up the logo with tape it will remedy the hazard. The wrist support is a little flimsy so be sure to have hand wraps on whenever you spar with them.

It fits my hands great, it doesn’t squish the tips of my fingers together and make them numb by the end of a training session.

My oldest son started showing an interest in boxing, so I got these for him to practice a little with - the cheapie ones we had previously were getting old, and weren't anywhere near as good.I like the straps on these - they keep everything secure and supported for you while sparring. The gloves overall feel extra THICK and solidly built - yet are decently lightweight for ease of movement and agility. The colors are vibrant and bright, and while this is made from synthetic material, they just feel good overall during use.My son enjoys using these on a punching bag, and I've also enjoyed testing them out for myself and decided that I may want a pair for myself. :) I didn't think there would be such a huge difference in the quality and feel of them from our cheaper ones, but now I'm sold. We are not pros by any stretch of the term, but I'd say (in my unprofessional opinion) that these are more than sufficient for beginner - intermediate levels, and make a really good practice set that is durable and built to last.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.723879
user|R28FOWOTXATB4U|B07VQNTDHC|B07VLC7QCC|Lashello|5|October 15, 2019|1571104800|Ringside = Quality|This is my initial review for the Ringside Bullet Sparring Glove, and I'll continue updating it as i use it.I recently received my ringside bullet gloves, and I am very happy with it. In the past, I had boxing gloves from other brands, that used to rip and the quality was very poor, and they weren't good for sparring session as they were to rough for it, but this time around I wanted to try something different and better.The ringside bullet gloves are well made and are of very high quality. The padding is thick about 2 inches thick, and the fit of the entire glove is very comfortable. The color I got is mostly white all over with some blue and green. Each glove weighs about 16 ounces which is about 454 grams. The ringside bullet gloves are nicely weighted and are made of material that allows for moisture wicking.A great feature of the gloves are the Velcro straps at the bottom of the gloves, they are large and wrap around my wrists firmly. They provide a great deal of support and easy. Another one of my favorite features in the bullet gloves is the space for the thumbs, it is super comfortable and secure because the thumbs are attached to the main part of the glove, also the thumbs have well positioned holes which allow for extra breathability.Moreover, the ringside bullet sparring gloves are designed based on IMP Tech: injected molded foam technology, which means that foam is specially and specifically molded for the best possible fit, also allowing for a higher resistance to wear and tear. I love the support and comfort that I get from wearing these sparring gloves. They are honestly the best gloves I have ever worn and used plain and simple. Highly recommended.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.723881

They are more for bag work (hitting an inanimate object rather than a person). Because they're so stiff, they are a little uncomfortable with the hand position, forcing it to remain curved at that angle. There is no give in the padding, so hitting someone with these gloves would hurt. I wouldn't wear these gloves to spar with anyone I respected!The wrist is probably the best feature of these--that's the one part you do want to be stiff/supportive.They'll stay in the gym bag, but they won't make it onto the mat unless they lose some of that stiffness/firmness with work (which remains to be seen).|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.724011

I waited because I actually got Covid and it took me out of my workouts for over a month. So now I have been using these for at least 3 months of use. They are holding up well. The first 2 months was about 3 times per week average. The last month was about once per week (recovering from Covid is a pain - muscles do not recover quickly at all)They are still in perfect condition. Again I am using a heavy bag, I weigh over 200 pounds and I use them very hard. Now I am only doing 20 minutes at a time but was doing up to 60 minutes a session the first couple months of using these.I have seen no signs of significant wear, and no tear whatsoever. They also protect your fists very well. As long as you wrap correctly they will work very nicely for you.For $20 these are very good, at least for training at home. I would not recommend them for actual matches or sparring. but why waste good gloves practicing at home if you can avoid it?I will update this again after a month (and as well after 3)So far so good. I use my heavy punching bag nearly every day. Since getting these I have used these gloves exclusively to test out their durability.The gloves are great. They are the exact weight stated and have not yet shown signs of tearing.in a few more weeks I will update. After that I will only update once they start tearing to give an idea of how long they may hold up. If they last even 3 months the $20 would have been worth it.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.724344

I have small hands and I feel packed into these things. My fingertips are at the ends of the gloves and I'm a little concerned about long term circulation in my thumb. The loaner Venums that I use at my MMA gym have a lot more room. I wear padded gloves with wrist wraps inside those and still have room to spare. There's no way I could do that with these. I'm not even sure I could comfortably wear wrist wraps by themselves. I guess I'm going to keep just to use to work on combos at the heavy bag at my fitness gym. Time will tell if these are going to break in or be comfortable enough. If not I'm not going to cry about the money at this price. I will follow up after a couple sessions with them.Update: I used these a couple times now and I really like them. I am able to get into them with wrist wraps on. They are snug but I have no circulation issues. They seem to be taking the beating very well. I am pleased with these gloves.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.724626

I've used these now 3-4 times a week for 3 months and they look brand new! The only thing I would recommend is getting a charcoal insert for the smell.

They are starting to get old (aka smelly, they haven’t come apart at all) and I plan to buy another pair soon. They have a great feel to them when I hit the bag and are nice and snappy. For the price, they are well worth it! Great for beginners or more experienced boxers. I am a female with smaller hands and these don’t feel as huge as my other gloves.

Mine also came smaller than I expected ( I weigh 175lb and stand at 5’10”), the 16oz glove fit rather snug, I’d advise going a size bigger and buying hand wraps for beginners.

They are fairly comfortable to wear, not quite top king, hayabusa or fairtex quality though.Besides a small thread of the stitching pulling out(easy fix with a tiny drop of superglue to prevent it from pulling out further) there has been no ripping or tearing, gloves still hold there shape nicely. Would highly recommend over the similarly priced everlast gloves.UPDATE: I retired this pair after about 6 months to move on to some fairtex bvg1's, that seems to be about all you'll get out of these gloves for the price point. With that being said they are still an excellent option for a beginner.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.724945

I take boxing classes ~5 times a week and have notice the inside of the gloves are tearing. I clean and take care of my gloves. For only having them for a month, this seems like VERY quick wear and tear. All of the inside seams are coming apart. If you are doing light boxing these MAY be okay.

I initially used the gloves at the gym and of course they were very good. These gloves are nowhere near as padded as the ones I originally used at the gym. Much less comfortable for that reason and kind of difficult to get off and on quickly which is what is needed in the class. I guess for the price they are ok but I wish I’d have spent the extra $30 for a good pair. They are super cute though, so not a bad fashion accessory!|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.725304

That stated, I was going to splurge and get some Hyabusas until a buddy of mine bought a pair of these in blue. For under $35 these gloves can't be beat. Very strong gel inside and as stiff as my old Venoms. However, the interior is VERY SMALL.I'm 5'9 and 155lbs and even buying 14oz gloves, my little baby Trump hands had difficulty slipping em on with wraps. Once inside though, they're great. Plenty of thumb room and the breath strip in the middle keeps my hands cooler than before, even if only a little bit. Best of all, they have em in a variety of colors. I got the Lomachenko yellow ones and they look awesome and much more expensive than they actually are.

I found a contact # and email address online for the company and called one afternoon to report the issue. The guy that answered was so helpful and went above and beyond to correct the issue. I found out later that it was the National Sales Director's cellphone number that I had contacted and that it was 2am local time for him when I called. I still can't believe how helpful and polite the guy was after being woken up at 2am with a customer service issue and stayed with me until the issue was corrected. ZTTY sent me a new pair of gloves and they have been great.

Sturdy and durable stitching all around, decently padded glove. My main concern with this glove was how hard it felt against my wrapped knuckles upon punching. The spine of the glove is too stiff for my comfort and the glove was little too snug. This could be primarily because of how I wrap my knuckles.This could be a decent option for a beginner. At $45 this is the cheapest genuine leather gloves I’ve seen. I cannot generalize this review - as this glove has a lot going for it. It just didn’t fit my boxing needs.If the padding on the wrists and the back were a little softer - it may not cause so much impact on your knuckles.

Henriquez|5|October 3, 2012|1349229600|It isn't always about name brands: great feel, looks sturdy (novice boxer)|"Let me just start out by saying that I just picked up boxing. Not the b.s. cardio boxing classes at spa gyms. I mean the real deal, with a professional boxer as a trainer. I mention this because I went off of a review on some other commercial gloves and ended up buying what felt like toy gear (I won't name names, but you'd think being a Bronx brand synonymous with boxing, they would be weary about putting their name on something so cheap, weak and poorly built). The reviewer was using her gloves for a Crunch class; I should have known better. They periodically just popped off because the wrist straps were crappy, I couldn't make a tight fist because the shape was odd, and my thumb was constantly poking up instead of staying back where it should.Anyway, my trainer suggested I get my head out of my ass and invest in something longer-lasting. As a 5'8"", 160lb female novice, I was looking for something I could use for training, but nothing too heavy duty. So I wasn't looking for anything too overprotective (I do heavy bag and mitts, but I haven't graduated to sparring just yet). I saw that the 16oz gloves had some good reviews so I took a shot at the 12oz and I'm glad I did. First of all, this is a great price for leather gloves. It's a little more expensive than synthetic or ""cardio"" gloves, but I urge you novices like me to take the quality of your gloves seriously. It really makes a difference in your performance and reduces risk of injury.I can tell by the stitching that they'll last a lot longer than the toy I got last time around. The wrist straps are a plus for me--they're extra long and wrap around nicely, so it adds just a little more support to my wrists. The shape of the gloves feel much more natural with my fist, and I don't have any problem tucking my thumbs away (again, that toy really traumatized me). I think aesthetically the gloves are appealing too.If I had to complain about anything, I would say that the gloves are a little more snug (with wraps) than I was expecting. This is the price you pay for buying online--you don't get the chance to try them on. I don't mind because it isn't that much more snug. I think, though, that guys should take that into consideration when buying. When I wear these gloves out, I'm going to look into the 14oz version.This is a lesson well-learned: sometimes brand names are all hype. I'm really happy with these gloves. I'll check in after a few months with an update as to whether they hold up to heavy use."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.725880

What I don’t like is the foam. It feels super cheap. There is no density to it at all. When doing push ups with the gloves on, it feels like you’re on your knuckles. The padding is very ineffective.

You need hand wraps with these gloves.Fit:I have average ""Large"" 21cmhands. Pretty much every type of glove out there I wear a large. So I was a little concerned about getting 12oz mitts. They fit fine. Snug but can still wear wraps. I probably could have gone with the 10oz but I was worried about the fit. Now, I'm not and will probably purchase a pair of 10oz.Support:I have used MMA gloves for a long time. Even for the heavy bag but I'm 52 now and want to protect my hands and wrists better. However, I am so used to focusing on knuckle wrist alignment that I could tell immediately that these mitts do not line up my hands and wrist correctly. They pull the hand back and that is dangerous. So when I used them the first time my hands and wrists wore out really quick simply trying to align them correctly. So I had to wrap them. That seemed to solve the issue.Also, it's hard to make a good fist. Thumb is pinned to the index so it sits forward and not down. I understand why they do this but it's really foreign to me and I'm not a fan.Quality:Quality is good. Solid build.Feel:Bulky. To be honest it is going to take some time to feel comfortable in mitts again. So a lot of this is my own issues. Still I know my hand wrist alignment. These gloves do not support me properly.Recommendation:If you are used to MMA gloves and have hands my size but want more protection get the 10oz and wrap your hands.I will continue to use these but will likely end my heavy bag work wearing MMA gloves once I tire out. Giving me time to focus on distance and hand alignment."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.725932

It's very useful and is pretty much the main reason I like these gloves. They are easy to put on and take off which is nice (as compared to their higher end gloves which have dual straps for the wrist).Thats about it in terms of things I liked. The threading has started coming off in certain areas after 3 months of regular use. The padding is stiff and unforgiving on your knuckles. I've had to incorporate silipos gel squares into my wraps due to the lack of knuckle protection with just wraps.The bar on the inside of the glove to grip on is basically for looks and does not serve as a function like it does on their higher end gloves.I guess I prefer softer and stiff gloves than these but if you like dense foam with little forgiveness then these are for you. If not, then I'd suggest their premium level gloves over these. Mind you, I'm only familiar with their old model of premium gloves, not the newest model.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.726062

These gloves are nice for me and they fit perfectly and without much issue. After putting the gloves on, I would say these are very comfortable and not extremely tight. The straps are secure and you can easily fit your hand into the glove without issue.The gloves are not that breathable but I did not expect them to be so my gloves make me sweat pretty much every time. I actually air them out after every practice. The boxing gloves do require a little bit of breaking in to really get them to be easier to move your fingers but they at least protect my hands well. The gloves are a snug fit so you can rest assure that they will not slide off your hand. Also it does not cut off the circulations or anything to my fingers or hands which is great. The gloves are pretty thick and protective. It does have a slight weight but nothing that makes it extremely exhausting to wear but it does tire me out after using it for a few hours. The gloves do feel pretty comfortable and does not rub your skin or anyway. The padding really feel great and really protective. The velcro is very strong and does not wear downafter several use. Overall the gloves are durable, comfortable, and fits great. Just be aware they take time to get used to. The stitching is good and I have not seen any issues with cracking and such but I expect them too after prolong and constant use.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.726182

(these were just too wide inside) I had originally been looking at the S4's, which he also got me so I could decide which was a better fit/comfort. They were both mediums and had much better padding. I went with the T3's as they have the double strap design that allows for a less tight feeling on my forearms (i also wear my smart watch so this helped with that as well).the S4's were pretty tight and the splinting felt a little stiffer. I can feel the cushioning difference and I am more accurate on my punches. these are still a smidge tight inside with wraps but I know they will loosen over time with more use.these are definitely worth the price if you are a more serious kick boxer or boxer.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.726293

Great wrist support although the double strap system can be a bit of a pain in between rounds. The first pair wore through the knuckles in less than a year, so for the second pair I went with their highest-end leather gloves thinking that they'd be more durable.Sadly, I was wrong. These gloves both wore out where the thumb attaches and I contacted Hayabusa due to their advertised warranty\satisfaction guarantee. I spoke with a very nice customer service rep, who- after exchanging several emails, informed me that their Design department determined that it wasn't a ""common damage"" they were not willing to cover it and I was SOL. I don't mind paying a premium for higher-quality products, but when I do I expect that they'll be of a higher quality and that when they fall short- the manufacturer will remedy the issue."|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.726338

Two heavy bag sessions were not enough to break it in for me. It was alright…but I had to try the LX version. I went for the brown Italian leather….WOW!!! What a difference! The best way to describe is, it fit like a glove. I have large thinner hands but I was able to immediately begin some hard heavy bag work. They felt soooo good!! Wrist support is amazing, I wear hand wraps and it’s tight but doable, the gloves make a good sound on the bag, and they look, feel, and smell stunning! Excellent quality ☝🏼👌 they might not last quite as long as the fake leather, but take care of them and they should last you a good couple years at least. Worth every penny in my opinion :) I’ll be returning the synthetic ones and keeping the lx version 🖤|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.726343

Hayabusa T3 - ($150) Very well designed. the double velcro closure is the best closure system i've personally used.It has foam splints which both helps prevent unwanted wrist alignment if you fudge a hook and also from blocking hooks.Foam feels really good (14oz), enough protection and not like hitting with a pillow.I ultimately chose to keep this glove because of it's superior wrist support, which is specifically important to me due to recurring wrist issues.2. Hayabusa H5 - ($100) It's got a single strap closure, but the fact that it's partially elasticized makes it easy to get a secure closure on it.Foam feels pretty similar to the T3.The wrist splits seem to be only slightly less affective.overall i think this glove is a very high value.3. Hayabusa T3 LX - ($200) pretty much identical to the T3 but with leather.The colors are simple but elegant.I'm only rating this lower than the above because i think the $200 price tag lowers the value quite a bit.4. Hayabusa S4 ($50) - better wrist support then the below options, but the materials and fit definitely feel sub par to the above models.What really turned me off on this model is that the wrist closure just fits oddly, almost rectangular feeling.5. Sannabul Essentials Gel - very inexpensive.The materials and don't seem that bad, but the fit isn't as secure as i'd like.. literally no wrist support, you can just fold the glove in half at the wrist.6. Venom Elite -pretty much same deal as the sannabul but more expensive.Other notes, these gloves will last most people years and i think it's worth spending $100+ for some support and quality.I'd highly recommend you try the T3 but if you want a $100 cap i would go for the H5 or a good old pair of twins special gloves (which i've gone through three pairs of over the last 15 years). happy striking.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.726365

I've had the Hayabusa shin pads for over 5 years and there have been no issues. Unfortunately, these gloves are not of high quality and fell apart just over a year after purchasing them. The leather just cracked and tore even though I was EXTREMELY meticulous about taking care of them, cleaning, drying and conditioning them regularly.The most disappointing piece here is the fact that Hayabusa does not care about the quality of their product outside of the 90-day window. They purport to be a top of the line brand, but do not back up their product. I spent the extra money for these thinking that they would stand behind the quality of their product, but they do not. I've worked with other companies that would gladly replace a product outside of the return window because the CARE ABOUT THEIR QUALITY. Hayabusa, unfortunately, does not care about standing behind their product.

Like many of the reviews state, they offer phenomenal wrist protection. It takes away that fear of hurting your wrist when throwing hard punches, now I don’t have to worry about that anymore, I can have a more intense workout and build up a good sweat. The interior of the glove is soft and it feels well built and the interior is not loose so your hands slide in and out with ease.

I don't know who approved the design for these gloves, but my god they are absolutely horrible. First off, the gloves are too snug where you can't comfortably wear them with hand wraps because they cause them to cut off circulation to your hands and become painful. The wrist area is tight and would protect your wrists if it weren't for the slanted design that curves your wrist downward, which would cause a wrist fracture if too much power was behind the punch.

Unsafe design|I switched to these from TKB because i love how they look and I figured they must be good because expensive, but after a year of use or so I think they are why my hands always ache. The box your hand goes in is too wide so it does nothing to compress your hand on impact. Also the double close system is pointless (i have never even heard of a problem with gloves coming off) and inconvenient (it’s harder to drag them on over your wraps). Total style over substance. I just bought a new pair of TKB and they feel soooo gooood!|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.726418

These are great gloves. First, the leather is of high quality. It is easy to see, smell, and feel. Second, they are comfortable from the start, and the inner compartment is comfortable and does what it claims-it wicks away moisture. Third, I have never seen or felt a better wrist support system. I use these 3 times per week on the mitts and the heavy bag with Mexican-style wraps underneath. These are worth spending an extra $50 because of the quality and making my workouts an experience that I look forward to every week.

I also appreciate the inside material of the gloves because it is not too baggy, having the inside material be too detached from the outer glove can make it difficult to get your fingers all the way into the glove which is not an issue at all with these gloves. your getting what you pay for with these gloves and i definitely recommend these to any level boxer because they're easy to handle for beginners and more experienced boxers will appreciate the quality.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.726510

They are good i had the 139$ ones with engineered leather and its not the same this one is more smooth and has some imperfections as a real leather i used a bick4 leather conditioner on a small tag it really got dark like dark navy color not light navy or obsidian these are 14z i had 12oz before so it feels kinda bulky didnt get used to it i got my training today will update comment later i did water ressistance test and if you just drop a drop of water on them it wont absorb it its just gonna stay there as a bubble if you wipe your sweat off or your hands are wet it will absorb it it doesnt have grip on it like some leather purse its just smooth everything else is same as the 139$ ones i had those in white and gray 12oz pretty good just thought why not to upgrade to real leather i am still not sure if it is real leather for sure i hope it is it has a feel of microfibers on it and in the materials it doesnt say anything about leather just some foam and cotton fibers if you want to try these gloves buy 139$ones with engineered leather then if you really want real leather get these but protection is amazing on these the splints take your hand form and feel really comfy after couple hours of training these dont require break in since its already half stretched first time you wear them it will feel tight it will get better later i will be using diy glove cleaner to disinfect them its a spray bottle with a 150ml of regular white non alcohol vinegar 15/30 drops of tea tree oil and some lemongrass grass oil you need to put as much as the oil is strong and pure if its 100% pure and really hard smelling use less if its weaker use more fake oils wont mix and will just float on the water so just get natural ones i really like the maple holistics they sell 30ml essential oils amd are really good they mix and perform good tea tree pil helps with smell and bacteria while lemongrass just has a heavy lemon scent you can use some other oils instead of lemongrass but tea tree should be your base oil back to the gloves they arent as good as i thought i expected to be WOW these are amazing but its just gloves dont expect to much hope they last and perform good again bick4 leather conditioner will darken them so buy obsidian or some other dark color so it wont darken as muchTHE IMAGES show the tag after bick4 moisturizing i only did 1 plyUPDATE:protection is great to feel inside the glove is great same as the 139$ I asked my mom is it really one and is it good leather she said its an amazing leather she didn't even touch them just by the looks she gave it 10/10 my mom ""Great leather I know what a good leather looks like this very good one"" that's what she said just be really careful this leather can scratch very easy since its full-grain leather I will be posting more images and updates WASH YOUR HANDS BEFORE PUTTING THEM ON AND KEEP YOUR NAILS SHORT WEAR HAND WRAPS TO KEEP THE SWEAT IN THE HAND WRAPS NOT THE GLOVESleave them to air dry keep away from the sunlight and use some cleaner or disinfectant you can make your own by buying those esssentials oils (tea tree, lemongrass for the smell it has a lemon scent, and lavender its antibacterial tea tree and lavender should be 70$ of your mix so anywhere from 4/10 table spoons of vinegar and from 10/30 srops off those oils and everything else is water) shake before use real oils should mix well into the water fake one will float on top maple holistics is good brand 30ml is enough for like 10 bottles of those cleaners"" and overall these gloves are good aside from that it will scratch faster then other leather since full grain one is not sanded and protected and just left as it is but its very durable and strong if you keep them nice and take care of them they will last couple years.EDIT: so its been a month or more i still use my cleaning solution and it works amazingly not only for gloves but shin guard hand wraps none of my equipment has any smell (air dry them)they are comfy and i got used to 14oz they were bulky but now they are feeling better break-in period passed and now they feel free on inside very satisfied with my purchase but still dude that 180$$$$ smakaroniesi like it. i will get more pics in coupe days i am kinda lazy rn will get more soon :) i will be updating this comment ntil they rip break or get destroyed so it should be fun for those who read this in a year or so."|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.726514

When i first used this, it was very soft on the inside and you can feel its luxury. Overall, it is totally worth the money, and will also last a long time. The dual x band wrist support is the best part.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.726525

These things are incredible. I feel like I'm getting better punches and hitting harder. Chuckling by how much harder I can hit with without worrying about wrists. Surprisingly cool and breathable. Was using them out in Texas heat and they dried out nicely.I love the classy old school look, security, padding, and speed. Also they're not covered in logos.Buy them|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.726532

The main issues was the velcro on the secondary strap sticking to the inside liner and your hand wraps while trying to strap them on.When you have one glove on,this becomes quite a task.They aren't the worst, but they aren't the best.I'd say go with a pair of Reyes over these.My pair of 18oz Reyes is going strong after 3 years."|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.726543

En segundo lugar, los guantes son más ligeros que el peso indicado, en mi caso compré de 12 oz, pero al pesarlos en la báscula resultaron ser de 10 oz. Tercero, los guantes se sienten muy frágiles como si no estuvieran hechos para durar. No obstante, tengo que decir que solo se trata de la primera impresión. Una vez aclarado todo esto y después de 3 meses de uso tengo que decir que son los mejores guantes que he probado. Son muy cómodos y las molduras hacen que se ajusten perfectamente a las manos, lo cual ayuda a reducir las pequeñas lesiones que se presentan en los entrenamientos. El amarre de la muñeca es lo mejor que he probado, se siente muy seguro y también ayuda a evitar lesiones, además de que el velcro doble de la correa es de la mejor calidad. Al principio tenía dudas sobre la calidad de la piel, pero hasta ahora ha resultado muy buena. El color se ha oscurecido con los entrenamientos, especialmente en la parte que hacen contacto con el costal y en las partes donde les cae sudor por lo que ahora el tono es más parecido al de la publicidad como se ve en las fotos 2 y 3. He tenido guantes Cleto Reyes y de otras marcas locales de México que también son muy buenas, pero definitivamente estos son los mejores. Son caros, pero lo valen.

Everything about these gloves feels muffled, silenced, oya and these gloves are heavy.Pros:Good looking glovesAlot of wrist supportGood paddingYou can punch as hard as you want and have no painCons:These gloves are hot not breathable all you notice is ur hands heating up which i usually dont mind but these feel like hand warmers!The material is like suede so when u punch your shots are muffled which i didnt like i personally like the loud whappss n powss other gloves make.When u punch these gloves feel dead they have no feedback which can be a good or bad thing depending on u. i dont like it i prefer a little bounce n feedback.These gloves are tight around the wrist and short on finger length. They have a lot of hand space for hand wraps but dont buy if u have big hands i have normal hands n they fit me snug.I have only tried the Hayabusa T3 LX ITALIAN LEATHER.

I wanted to have a cheap pair of 10oz gloves to use in my home gym as alternative to my 16oz sparring gloves (my other 12oz pair was fully worn out)…but that was not a smart decision.- the good: they are cheap, they look good and they somewhat hug well your wrist.- the bad: the knuckles are horribly unprotected, and the material used to curve the glove is too hard on them when you hit a bag, focus mitt or other. It even bothers your hand when doing push-ups and keep the gloves on, so that if you are new and not conscious about what you do, you can get seriously hurt.Overall, this was the second (and last) workout that I’ll ever do in them. I’ll probably return them to Amazon.Yet, they are not totally horrible, clearly not for me, and if you plan on actually hitting things, your knuckles will hurt.I just bought a pair of Hayabusa T3 as a replacement, expensive, about 5x the price, but they will last a long time and thousands of punches.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.726669

I got these strictly for heavy bag workouts, and I've been using them for ~5 months. For that purpose, they've been good - the outside has held up well, no tears or anything, they fit well and they feel good. As I've used them more, gotten more accustomed to punching, and have begun punching harder though, some issues have started to show. It seems like the interior padding has begun to compress, such that I'm getting more abrasions and blistering on my knuckles. I haven't used wraps with the gloves up till now, but I'll probably start adding that or else switch to some different gloves. I have a feeling they don't compare that favorably to higher-end gloves, but the price tag also doesn't compare - they seem to me (again as a very inexperienced user) like a good value. Overall I've enjoyed using them, and I feel like for the money they've served me well as a beginner pair of gloves.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.727024

user|R3L14HQJ78NCBG|B07ZNPTKQ6|B07ZNQ6W37|Mike2017|2|May 7, 2020|1588816800|UPDATED REVIEW|I’m not a professional boxer or anything but I have been going at the heavy bag for a couple of months in order to get my cardio. For these past couple of months I had been using the standard Everlast gloves that have the elastic strap on the bottom which are fine but they Definitely don’t feel snug or completely sturdy on the hand. After a couple of hand injuries I decided to look into new gloves and I came across these. I went with the 16oz to train a little harder and I have really big hands and these things fit like a dream. First off the ability for the strap to wrap completely around the wrist make these feel so much more comfortable and secure when you put them on. The texture inside the gloves are by far way better. These gloves dry faster and feel better. Bc I haven’t used them for a while I don’t really know how durable they will be so I will update but so far I’m loving themUpdate:I used these gloves for a couple of sessions and even with the same hand wrap style, warm up, and bag hits they started hurting my wrists. I thought bc the wrap goes completely around the wrists that they would have a more secure fit on my wrists but that wasn’t the case.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.727476

Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the outside layer where the graphics are came in torn and ripped a bit, kinda like a heat burn. I figured that was due to a heat press or something when putting the label on.

I ordered 12 ounce gloves - I like to feel the impact, but don’t want to injure myself. I try them on the larger hand first (no humans hands are both equal sizes).The hand compartment is the size of a child’s hand. As a standard, I put the gloves on my larger hand, first without wraps - to give me an idea of how they will feel with wraps - and the second time with wraps. I had to force my hand into these gloves with the wraps on, my hand wasn’t even curved to begin making a fist and there was a lot of pressure on my thumb joint; poorly made and poorly fit gloves.Unless you are under 5’6” - I highly doubt these gloves are for you.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.727670

Though, for my hands, they were very uncomfortable.I wore these for a few rounds before they became very uncomfortable. Really started to hurt my thumb. Ringside is usually not a bad brand at all. I guess I should have paid a bit more. For this price range if you're just looking to get some work in, I'd say Title or Fighting gloves are a good bargain.

However, they were high quality and lasted over 10 years. When I received these my first thought was that the quality will be compromised as they are made of a synthetic material over leather. However, these feel really nice and well constructed.The knuckle padding seems very thin but they provide enough cushion for my heavy bag workouts.

I compared them to a set of sparring gloves from Ringside. The two pair of gloves differ significantly in price, with the sparring gloves retailing at four times the cost of the training gloves. The sparring gloves are real leather, while the training gloves are synthetic. At a glance you can't tell other than by the scent of the leather in the sparring gloves. The training gloves have molded protective foam in a single layer while the sparring gloves have four layers of latex, PVC, and poly foam. For both pairs, the thumb is attached to prevent your thumb from being pulled back. The palms are ventilated in both sets. The sparring gloves provide a bit more protection at the wrist. I found both sets to be comfortable. The training gloves obviously are meant for use with a bag and should provide good service, particularly for a beginner. Those with greater power and a desire to use these in a ring should go for the higher quality of the sparring gloves. The training gloves weigh nearly one pound each, while interestingly the sparring gloves weigh just a fraction less (.99 pounds vs .97 pounds). Both are made in Pakistan.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.727989

However, after only about 5 heavy bag workouts the outer covering started to tear, crack and break with seams splitting near the thumbs and palm. To be fair I'm not sure it was an issue with the gloves in general or if I just got a pair from an old batch. Another reviewer noted that the rubber vinyl covering seemed dry rotted and so did mine. I bought one of the colors that was on sale thinking it was being offered at a lower price because they were discontinuing the color or something. Now I think it's because they had sat in storage too long and dry rotted. Therefore I would be careful of any of the discounted colors and stick with the full price item. That said I did not want to take another chance so I returned these and got RDX Maya Hide Leather Boxing Gloves Gel Sparring Glove Punching Bag Mitts Training Muay Thai F7 instead. They cost twice as much but the leather covering sold me.

I throw lots of punches, especially on the heavy bag and my hands and wrists were protected after 12 rounds of use--no knuckle pain or wrist stiffness/soreness which I have gotten using other gloves. I like the look of the gloves as well. The evolution of the appearance of boxing gloves has led a look that, at times, isn’t very functional. I have struggled with finding gloves that fit my hands comfortably. Other modern gloves provide less space in the fingers, which make for an extremely uncomfortable squeeze when making a fist. These are simple, straight-forward, comfortable boxing gloves that fit my hands beautifully--comfortable without feeling loose. The quality and stitching are good--they have withstood a pretty good banging and haven’t shown any signs of breakage in the stitching. Better still, I haven’t noticed a change in the form or shape of the padding as I’ve begun to break them in.For the price, I have found an effective, functional and durable glove; I’m impressed.Update: The glove split from the stitching after 150+ hours/15 sessions.

There is great coverage on the top the front and over the thumb, but very little on the sides. If I had one wish it would be that the padding extended a bit more beyond the lateral side of my hand, but generally this is not much of an issue.The broad closure works well and the velcro keeps the glove secure.The major problem is ventilation.There are only five holes in the dead center of the palm.None extending across the palm and none on the thumb itself.Vinyl is absolutely non-breathable and your hands will definitely sweat after a vigorous workout.All-in-all, I don't think you could get a much better glove in this price range.On the positive side, this is a real training glove--not a stage prop or a kids toy.It has more than adequate padding such that it can be used in real life.Sadly, the ventilation issues were a major problem for me, leading to sweaty hands and the construction is solid enough for now, but given the workmanship and the materials it is not likely to last a long time.That said, for someone who is just starting and doesn't want to invest in a set ofhigh-end gloves, this could easily do the trick.And for someone who only occasionally likes to spar or use the bag, these would be okay.Or they could be the spare pair that you leave in the gym because you don't want someone walking away with your good gloves.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.728234

Only time will tell how well this will fair against my full sized back, which I use every day as part of my training.I will update my review regularly to let you know how the gloves have held up.But so far so good.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.728236

Using a punching bag is a great upper body/arm workout, for men and women, even if you never plan on competing. These are perfect for that.These gloves from Vine were offered only in a large size. If you have smaller hands, or if you're a woman, be aware of that. I have medium-sized hands and they don't feel HUGE, but they do feel like I could have gone down one size.I'm also not sure how long the Velcro will hold up, though for now it seems tight.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.728239

The quality of these gloves are better than most you would find at a sports store. Unfortunately these are not weighted so that's one drawback.I use these on a punching bag my roommate has set up and I like how much easier it is to punch now that my whole hand is covered versus wearing the smaller gloves I had before.

These are useful to my husband and son for bag training, as we have a heavy bag in our exercise room. They fit both comfortably, given the adjustability of the wrists, notwithstanding a nearly 100 pound weight difference.

These gloves are non-leather and seem to be made of good quality materials. They look and feel really nice. I received the L/XL ones. I'm female, but have fairly big hands with skinny fingers, and they fit pretty well. They were loose around the wrists, though, but I have very small wrists. My husband has very big hands, and they fit him better. When hitting punching bags barehanded, my hands, wrists, and head would hurt because it was very jarring. These are very cushioned, and I can hit without pain. I'm happy with them!|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.728248

I'm not a professional boxer by any means, but I do like to hit the bag every now and then, so I was excited to give these a try.First and foremost, I have relatively large hands, and I found the XL size worked perfectly as advertised. After a few hours of use, these gloves are starting to break in nicely. They feel good when I hit the bag, and with each hit they soften up a bit more.These are definitely entry-level boxing gloves for the beginner looking to get started with boxing.

All of my boxing equipment (boxing gloves, sparring gloves, wrist wraps, etc.) have always been a different brand. I have looked at Ringside equipment before but this is the first time I have had the opportunity to try something out.I received the 16 oz gloves and they fit great. They are a bit stiffer than my other gloves but are still quite comfortable. The quality is great for training gloves; there are no issues with the stitching or material whatsoever.The velcro closure is more wrap around than on my other gloves which I like. I would never use boxing gloves without some additional wrist protection (wrist wraps or wrap gloves) because I do not want to hurt my wrists. I had a trainer teach me how to box with a bag and spar with him a bit as well; many people do not realize you do not just walk up to a bag or a B.O.B. and start punching away. You need wrist protection as well as need to use proper form and keep your fists tight when throwing punches or you will do some serious harm to yourself.Overall, I would recommend these gloves for general bag training or light sparring.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.728261
user|R2OFZRIJBZ8MNC|B00UTFRMOI||Armando N. Roman|3|June 17, 2015|1434506400|[Manny/Floyd boring fight joke]|I've used a lot of different gloves over the years for various martial arts and more recently, boxing. I can say with certainty that right now we have access to some of the best gear ever created, and not just when it comes to the professional stuff. There are a lot of great gloves for beginners that don't break the bank and offer good protection for your hands. These Ringside Pro Style gloves are good for the price, but there's nothing about them that makes them stand out from the rest. These are about as middle of the road as you can get. I'll tell you right now that the 3 star rating isn't bad- these are about what you'd expect in this price range.I got the 16oz L/XL pair in blue and they look just like they do in the stock image. I'm not a fan of blue but I think these look pretty good with the white and black thrown in there. The gloves have average padding and will keep your fists safe during light sparring or bag work if you choose to not have a pair just for bags/pads. I felt like they felt a bit fluffy compared to others I've used before, but when I practiced with them on, everything felt ok. The gloves close with one velcro strap. There's very little wrist support here, and you can move your hand all over the place with the glove on. When throwing punches, make sure you're using proper form so you don't accidentally hurt your wrist.Overall these are good for beginners who have just started out in boxing. If you get these and feel like boxing is your thing after a couple of months, I recommend upgrading to a better pair. Ringside has some pretty good stuff for people new to the sport, so check out their other products.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.728263

I wasnt trying to pay alot of money for Boxing Gloves. They look great on the outside, when you put them on, it is snug, so try to make sure, you get the right size. These boxing gloves can be used for Martial Arts as well, I use them to try to get some exercise in. Does it seem like these gloves might not last a while.

I will say, the inside of the gloves are relatively small so if you have big hands you might want to be aware of that, also if your hitting a heavy bag with 12oz gloves you might want to wear hand wraps to prevent wrist injuries if your hitting hard on a heavy bag.

My only complaint and the reason for 4 stars is the padding inside my right glove is a bit odd. I have to wiggle my fingers over the pad and pull it in place correctly.

Not being sure if this is something I'll stick with long-term yet, I just wanted a decent set of gloves for an inexpensive price. I've done 3 classes so far with these gloves, and have been very happy with them so far. When I first put them on I was concerned about how stiff they felt, but after just 3 1-hour classes, they've already started to feel much more comfortable. Maybe I'll step up to a more expensive glove down the road, but I don't feel you could find a better value for the price than these.

I've only been using them for just over a week, so maybe they'll get some stretch to them, but the wrist/forearm section is so stiff that it's hard to get it to wrap around my arm properly. The velcro strap is also sooooo short compared to other gloves - And since the gloves are so stiff (also in the top, finger portion), I have to use my teeth to get them on. Very hard to get on myself.Like I said, I love the weight distribution - how it carries weight on the forearms, not just in the glove, but I think the design could still use some work.

user|R23SBN9KJZLBOR|B07962X9YQ||Reviewguy|4|July 29, 2021|1627524000|Honest detailed review|I am someone that likes to Box and have been doing it for years. I also like to collect different boxing gloves. So this is just an unbiased review.PRICE AND VALUE FOR MONEYFirst of all, to the people saying Neverlast and giving this 1 star or 2. What did you expect? This is a glove that regularly goes on sale for 30 dollars. You can't compare this to something that is more expensive. Everlast has 100 plus dollar gloves that are better quality, but you get what you pay for. You have to go into this with realistic expectations.Now I gave these gloves 4 stars. Comfort was 4 and value for money was 4. I got these gloves for 35 dollars. They are worth 30-35 dollars. It looks like their current price on Amazon is showing 44 dollars. Yea, they are not worth that. They are a 2 star 44 dollar glove, but a 4 star 30 dollar glove.The gloves look unique and different from some other gloves in the 30-40 dollar range, but they are not the greatest quality even in this price range. You can find some nicer Title or Sanabul boxing gloves on the website in the 25-35 dollar range. If you really want to spend 40 dollars, there is the Rival econo bag gloves and they are much much better.Gloves are also curved a bit so you hit more with your knuckles, but a lot of people don't like that because it just feels a little weird compared to some other regular gloves. I did not mind it at all actually. Might actually be good for people that like throwing hooks.QUALITYThey are not the greatest quality gloves but solid enough. Even in this price range. I got 2 pairs of these specifically because they were on sale and I did not believe they would last even before I bought them. That should tell you a lot. Surprisingly, they have lasted well so far, but I do rotate my gloves weekly.The fake leather material is really thin. Like really thin. It also isn't bonded to the inside material very well. On the photos it looks like it is, but it isn't in real life. They are bigger gloves on the inside and it fits me because I have bigger hands. The mesh isthin and not the greatest quality, but my hands sweat a lot so I like it a lot because it let's them breathe really well. Because of the mesh, the gloves feel nicely broken in too.SPARRING/BAG WORKThese are more for bag work but you could use them for sparring too without many issues. Because of the everlast shield thing, the weight is distributed differently. There isn't as much padding in the strike area, and it's also pretty stiff when brand new. Great for bag work, and decent for sparring after it gets broken in a bit. I have not had any sparring partners say anything bad though.CONCLUSIONThese are solid 4 star gloves if you can find them for 30-35 dollars. I would not pay much more for them. Even in the 30 dollar range, there is much better gloves out there if you really look. The gloves are pretty comfortable and look nice. Treat them well and they should last a while depending on how often you box and what kind of work you use them for.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.729105

These are ok gloves for a beginner or someone who is not a heavy puncher. The padding is very soft, when you aggressively hit the heavy bag there just isn't much protection. The design of the glove almost pushes your hand forward causing your punches to land with a slight bend in the wrist, I had to constantly be mindful of that and force my hand straight when hitting the bag hard. The other thing I really didn't like about these gloves was there is way too much room inside the glove itself...causing your hand to shift In the glove at impact. I wrap with a full 180 mexican style wrap and was even adding athletic tape before my wrap to try and fill the void in the glove. All in all, this is not an ""elite"" or ""pro"" glove.

I have almost 20 years of experience in martial arts and boxing, actively competing 10-12 years ago. Now I’m doing bagwork and sparrings every other day just for fun.

The “size” is just the weight of the glove which is what you want for training specifically to help increase your speed during an actual competition or match. I took these through my Muay Thai class and the wrist support was phenomenal. I even forgot to remove my watch for these gloves (I don’t tape) and there was no discomfort with my strikes. I’m slower for now, but these condition you for just that. The breathability offered from the mesh absolutely makes a difference while wearing and taking them off. Also, they just look great.

The gloves still seem to be holding up as expected and definitely provide adequate protection if you punch properly. Time will tell how well they hold up.I just received these new gloves today. This is my 2nd pair of Everlast bag gloves; the first pair was fine and these seem to be fine as well. I can't speak for the durability at this point, but my last pair held up well and for the price, it's what I expect. If you want something that's really going to stand the test of time, you can spend 4-5 times as much for a nice leather pair. I took these to the gym today for some light work on the heavy bag and had no issues. I bought the L/XL (my palm at the top measures ~ 3.75"" ) and it seems to be a fairly good fit. I worked fairly light on the bag until the gloves break in a little bit. The padding seems adequate. A couple of notes for prospective buyers to think about. Everyone's hand will fit a little differently, these are not custom gloves, but if you are close to the right size and strike properly with a tight fist the padding and structure of the glove should serve it purpose. Start off light and slow and work on a very tight fist when you strike - it will make a lot of difference; I learned this from multiple disciplines and more that 20 years of 'old school' martial arts."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.729363

I highly recommend these gloves for those who wants to work on heavy bag (focus on technique and angles of punches). The padding is not bulky and is decently thick which I like because I can throw more faster powerful punches without worrying damaging my knuckles and wrist. I would give these gloves 5 star however, the padding did not cover my finger joints which scratches my skin when I throw body hooks. Overall, great gloves and I'm happy with this purchase. In addition, I got 8 and 1/2 inch hands (measured around width part of the hands not counting finger and thumb) and I got the L/XL which fits me well because I wore hand wraps, if you don't wear hand wraps and got hands like me the S/M will fits fine too.

The Gloves DO fit but I must point out that the elastic strap has a section that digs into my lower thumb joint where it meets the wrist...(palm side). It's not so uncomfortable to stop me from wearing the gloves but it is there and I imagine it could cause blisters/rash after some significant training sessions.

I leave it outside or in my bathroom when not in use. These are great gloves. I removed the plastic rod that's inside the palm. Just used a blade to open one end and removed with a pair of pliers. Now they're a lot more comfortable. The wrist strap offers great protection but these are horrible for heavy bags. They're great for mitt work but not a heavy bag.

My first pair had to be exchanged because the Velcro wasn't even sewn into one of the gloves. The exchange was quick and easy so I didn't really care too much about it and chalked it up to getting a mistake. I use these with a canvas heavy bag. I do use 120"" hand wraps on my hands with these gloves and they work fine. My biggest complaint is that when I hit the bag, the canvas is scraping away at the knuckles on my fingers. I was hoping that these gloves would cover my fingers more. I'm a beginner so maybe I'm hitting the bag incorrectly or maybe it's my bag. When I hit the bag the canvas dents in around my glove and roughs up my knuckles just under the glove. I thought it might just be my hands so I ordered some athletic tape to wrap the knuckles on my fingers. I figured I'd mention it in case any one else has large hands and is considering this glove. Overall they are okay and breathe easier than full gloves."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.729704

They are comfortable, great for grappling and fairly sturdy. I say 'fairly' because my one complaint is how quickly the Velcro required replacement along the wrists. Less than half a year in, and I had to remove it and sew in another strip. I do use them a lot (5-6 days a week, an hour or more a day) which contributed to the velcro fail, but the strip I replaced on the worn out section (from a local fabric store) has actually fared better and is still going strong. The stitching in the finger slots has unraveled finally on one finger pair, but this is also an easy repair with needle and thread. If not for the velcro issue, I'd give them 5 stars, especially given the fact that the knuckles have taken a constant beating and the padding is still intact, with no tares in the materials along the back fist, or knuckles. Go with Everlast. The UFC and Tapout gear is marketing fluff, and of less quality. Everlast has been doing this a long time: long before cage fighting became a weekend warrior fad. Of course, if you want top of the line, go RDX, but that will be nearly twice as expensive in many cases.

I bought them because I wanted to have free access of my fingers so that I could jump rope and use a medicine ball during my heavy bag sessions. Right away I noticed that the glove was shifting around on my hand. Tore the skin of my third nucle of my index finger and made the rest of my knuckes sore from the shifting. The angle of the padding was contributing to the shifting. I had to switch to open palm blows because my hands were so sore. I really was hoping to have found a great pair of open finger gloves.BTW these were the lg/xtra lg size. Can anyone recommend a good comfortable pair ?|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.729841

It's like wearing an entire tire factory on your hands. The smell was so bad that I had to keep them outside my house. Even after 1 week, I could hardly stand having them in the car to go to the gym.Problem #2: If you have small hands, your bent knuckles hit right above where the glove bends. And the gloves are fairly stiff. The result is lots of knuckle chafing and not enough protection. I workout on a small-size speed bag, and even after wrapping my knuckles I was hurting after a workout. I haven't had this kind of trouble with other Everlast gloves. So I'm not quite sure what the deal is. But I would advise steering clear of these puppies.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.729900

I am not a hard hitter so its great for me but with the Gel Hand Wraps I got it added almost 1 or 2 more layers so Im ready to go. If you are concerned about if it will protect your hands on the bag I would suggest purchaes some gel hand wrapsyou can find some anywhere .Over all would I recommend these. YES!

I put the gloves on and the ""fingers"" started pulling away from the glove. I took out my old leather glove needles, stout thread, and an awl to re-stitch the fingers to the glove. The material is very sturdy and the sewing was difficult, but I got it done. The gloves provide a lot of wrist support and padding, but I still needed more hand support, so I ordered the Everlast wrap...also from Amazon. Now the gloves feel great. If you can't stitch up the fingers to the gloves, I don't think you'll be happy with the glove...I know I wasn't. It just didn't allow me to curve the padding to protect my knuckles and hands.

Roman|4|September 2, 2013|1378087200|Good gloves for beginner bag work or sparring.|"I recently got my brother into martial arts a few weeks ago, and let him use the Everlast Evergel training gloves I have. He took to them very quickly and decided that he wanted that same pair. Unfortunately, it seems that they're not available at the moment in our size (S/M), and he had to go around sporting good stores, trying on gloves to find something that was similar to those. The Everlast Train Advanced Wristwrap Heavy Bag Gloves here are what he got. At first I thought they looked a little weird due to the shape of the fingers on the outside of the glove, but tonight during practice, he did just as well as he did with my Evergel ones! When I tried them on, they seemed to fit a little better than my pair, and the construction was very similar. The only real difference is the lack of Evergel, which isn't a huge deal.These gloves are essential for practicing your striking on bags or mitts. First, they feature an 18 inch strap that secures with velcro around the wrist more than once. There's very little chance of either glove flying off, no matter how much force you put into a blow. They feature an Everfresh liner, keeping them smelling good without getting that dank gym-smell we've all experienced at least once when using someone else's gear. A few people have complained about the smell of the gloves, but I personally like it. It reminds me of the Ghostbusters toys from the early 90s! The padding on the outside is VERY firm and a big difference from my go-to gloves, the 4oz grappling gloves that Everlast also makes. Oddly enough, it doesn't feel that different when hitting a pad. All the fingers are protected inside the glove, as is the wrist.My favorite thing though, is the special design that the glove has right between the fingers and the palm. There's this little bar-type thingy that goes across the hand, and it helps your hand keep a fist easily. As soon as I noticed this on the gloves, I even said out loud ""oh wow, that's actually really cool"". For beginners, this is going to be a big help in keeping a strong fist while attacking.What keeps the gloves from getting a 5 star rating is the stitching issues. Like many others who buy Everlast products, it seems that this is the main problem. Threads here and there are sticking out, and it wouldn't shock me if I needed to repair my brother's gloves within the next couple of months if he keeps using them regularly. It should be noted though, that Everlast -does- have a warranty with their products. Be sure to screen cap your order information or keep the receipt to show them proof of purchase. Yeah, it's a lame problem that shouldn't be happening, and I wish they'd correct it...but that warranty is still there if you need it.I'm pretty proud of my brother for picking out a good first pair of gloves without my help, and recommend these to newcomers to the sport."|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.730181

Hand wraps are supposed to protect your skin from abrasion INSIDE of the glove, not against the heavy bag.These gloves would probably work for MMA-style training, but are not good for heavy bag training - and no one in their right mind would spar with you if you wear these gloves.If you want to do heavy bag, get the Title, leather, 14-oz boxing gloves. If you want to do sparring, get the Title, leather 16-oz gloves. Leather is much better - it breaks in well and lasts much longer than synthetic materials.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.730186

Mine fit nice and snug and I have no issues. On top of that you're still hitting something hard with your hand. One of the purposes behind this workout is to toughen up your knuckles. Man up or ditch the heavy bag and string up a memory foam pillow. Personally, after the workout I do a couple minutes without the gloves for the sole purpose of toughening up my hands.Overall, I like the gloves. The small/medium size fits perfectly and I have small but somewhat fat hands. I'm also very glad I got these because they have the wrist-wrap built in.

Most gloves come with only finger rings on the palm side to hold the glove to the hand, and not suprisingly they rip off easily rendering the glove useless. I was excited when I found these because they have a very sturdy underside construction. I recieved my gloves and used them a few times when I noticed there was a spot on the right hand where they hadnt completely sewn the leather over the pad. It was only on the pad just above the wrist and not the main pad so I ignored it. unfortunately it proved to be a sign of poor craftsmanship as the seem on the pad that covers the knuckle came completely undone rendering the glove useless the other day. I have had the Gloves for under 2 months, and use them for training 3-4 days a week. I understand I am what would be considered a heavy user, but the left glove looks as though it just came outt the box...pretty sure they are intended to last longer than 2 months. I would recomend these gloves as had this not happened I would have been very happy with them, but I would advise inspecting them thuroughly upon recieving them and send them back for new ones if they show any flaws regardless of how small. My theory is its a sign of an exhausted sweat shop worker who prolly made mistakes elsewhere if there are any visable flaws.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.730320

I like both and for just working the bag alone these are great. I haven't had any issues with scraping exposed digits across the bag (wavemaster xxl) and there is pretty decent wrist support. Also haven't had any issue with knuckles being scraped by the inside of the glove. The palm on this style of glove is enclosed which makes it slighly hard to grip battling ropes or other items if you are transitioning from them to the bag and I would advise you to go with the train advanced mma 7 ounce striking gloves which have an open palm. Both gloves are similar other then that. I got this style as the other pair are ""community"" gloves for our training room and I wanted my own set.The one drawback of both of the everlast gloves are the smell they had out of the bag. To me it is a chemical/gas type smell and will fill a small room and linger as long as the gloves are present and exposed. Guessing it is coming from the false synthetic leather. For at least a week it is extremely powerful and even after that for another week it is noticeable when working out as if you are keeping your hands up the gloves are close to your nostrils and the smell evident and not what you want to be sucking in if you are working hard and breathing heavy. After 2-3 three weeks of leaving them out (I recommend your garage or place outside the home) it does fade to where it isn't noticeable, but be prepared for it when you first get them."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.730327

I have hit a heavy bag with them and a BOB. They work well for both.Now the bad news.They smell awful.It's somewhat like burned rubber.I left them out in my garage for a couple of weeks when I first bought them to air them out. But there is still a slight odor to them.Enough that I notice it when I open the closet where I keep them.I've owned several pairs of gloves and other leather products and these are the only ones that stink like that.Also, if you don't wrap your hands, particularly well over your knuckles, you'll bleed if you hit enough.These gloves have a lot of padding to protect you but the inside of the glove that touches your knuckles (top joint, closest to where the fingers connect to the hand) seems to be too stiff or soemthing.They really irritate my knuckles when I hit, even with hand wraps.The good outweighs the bad here and I like hitting with these.I hope that smell goes away soon!I'd like to keep these!|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.730335

This set me up for a poor flex on the main knuckle pad. I'd read reviews about the finger thongs tearing loose and so on. However, when I retracted my hand enough so that the flex-seam below the main pad was just right below the knuckle-line, it was the perfect fit; great flex, padding in just the right place, and no wrenching the finger thongs to get the thing flexed. The top of the finger thongs now sits about half way down the middle bone of each finger. Once you get there, just wrap it up on the wrist and you're ready to go.

I have pretty wide but thin hands and they fit well with wraps but that is gonna be based on personal prefernce. There is some break in time needed and I recomend a hard heavy bag in high heat so you can get the leather loose and after a few hours they feel pretty decent. The wrist wrap isnt for people with skinny wrists which I have but over wraps it kinda does the job. The longeivty is yet to be seen but if they last a few months i'll be pretty happy with what I paid. The cushioning is more then adeuqate and there is no new damage to my hands just re opening some old ones that havent healed fully. Weight is pretty good but I dont like it for speed bag practice.With my long hands I have found I have had to modify the gloves so they sit higher on my hands. If you pull it all the way down your knuckles are dead center of the pad which isnt very flexible so I had to hike mine up a little bit so the crease is just above my knuckles, still tons of protection only alot less grip fatigue.Its a win for the price+3 weeks later+The gloves still havent really broken in and even with wraps if your hitting a harder bag you still wind up blowing holes in your knuckles. I wrap mine even with the gloves I am still finding my knuckles shreaded atleast once a week. They are holding up as well as can be expected but the upper foam peice is too long and needs a break so you can bend the hand into a fist easier as this is the primary reason i find myself I stoping is the forearm fatique.

The padding is solid, the wrist support is great, and they fit well. They are heavier than most bag gloves, but being marketed as ""advanced"" that is actually favorable. They entire design, however, falls apart on one key item. In order to have these open fingered gloves ""wrap"" around your closed fist as you punch, the design involves a leather ""thong"" stitched onto the leather of the glove in between your fingers, creating individual finger holes (you can see it on the palm side of the picture). At first use the snug leather loops helped close the glove in tight around my hand and the whole experience went great. After a few uses the leather thong began to stretch, and the glove no longer fit as well, but it was still usable. After a couple months the stitching came undone in between two of my fingers. This caused the knuckle part of the glove to just float above my hand like a stiff plank aligned with the back of my hand, leaving my knuckles completely unprotected, yet misaligning my punches, thus creating more friction on my knuckles than had I gone barehanded.It's disappointing because the gloves were great at the beginning, but due to cheap material/stitching, it didn't last very long. On a good note my dog now enjoys a new chew toy (with a spare in the waiting)."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.730351

I'm a 150-155lb, 5'7'' male with average sized hands and the Small/Medium size was too snug. The primary padding was rubbing against my middle-finger's knuckle and this was without wearing 180'' hand wraps. Putting on hand-wraps made it impossible to insert my hand. If in doubt, buy the larger size. However, I even have doubts about fitting into the large/Xtra-Large with hand-wraps.Wrist protection/Knuckle protection seem sufficient if your hands are small enough. Some of the construction of the ""leather"" is not satisfactory for my unit. There were loose threads around the finger-holes.I ended up returning my pair of gloves and bought a Ring-Side Super Bag Gloves. It's more pricey but the product has much more value that this Everlast one.

user|R3HKD9JNMN65RH|B001FX9FV6||Ryan|3|February 24, 2011|1298512800|Ok, as long as you don't have big hands|Let me start off by saying these gloves are very comfortable and provide adequate padding on the knuckles. The wrist strap is an added bonus as well to stabilize your wrist so you can hammer on the bag. Those factors are why I rated these gloves at 3 stars. However, if you are a larger fellow with extra large hands, these gloves could be a problem for you even if you get the L/XL size. They fit just fine putting them on over wrist wraps and everything, so space isn't the issue. When I started to punch however, then knuckle where your finger bends was almost completely exposed. To make matters worse, there is a leather...rib or almost wiring right where your fingers poke out of the gloves. So that is resting on the top part of my finger knuckles as I'm whaling on the bag. That created a lot of friction mainly on my right hand (power hand) and opened up some fabric burns after about 20 min straight on the bag.The first time I used them it was fine and I just had a little irritation, but I thought it was because I was coming off a little weird on the bag with my overhand right. I just came back from the gym and was only on the bag for about 5 minutes, hit the bag with about 5 power rights and the irritation on my knuckles opened up and started oozing blood. I was extra cautious about how I was hitting the bag because I thought I may have been hitting it a little incorrectly, but alas it was because the rib that I mentioned previously was digging into the top part of my finger knuckle when I hit the bag flush.So again, if your hands are big enough to have to order XL or above gloves (boxing, batting gloves, mittens...whatever), this probably isn't the glove for you. If you're buying these to work on bag technique or light sparring, you'll be fine. If you have big hands and want to work on power combos on the heavy bag, I wouldn't recommend these gloves. Maybe it's because I have some sort of unproportional finger to hand length or something, but these gloves are going to sit in my tuffbox until I ship out from Afghanistan in 6 months. Guess I'm switching back to the full hand boxing gloves.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.730373

user|R2X4Z1IR89VDTA|B001FX9FV6||Tom Z.|5|November 12, 2009|1257991200|Great All Around Gloves|I was looking for a pair of gloves to go with my new heavy bag that was a nice cross between comfort and protection.I tried on traditional full hand glove (traditional boxing style) but I was not a fan of the feel and lack of ability to use my fingers once the gloves were on. I then moved to the more MMA styled open finger style heavy bag gloves, and that was definitely the right direction.These gloves fit great, protect my hand even after hitting the bag for long periods of time and I still have the ability to move my fingers.I would definitely recommend these gloves and a pair of hand wraps if you plan to use the gloves for longer periods (definitely helps comfort) also the more I wear these the more comfortable they seem to get.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.730400

It's not like I'm going to throw them away, I'll keep fixing them, but I was hoping Everlast would have slightly better quality.After shipping I spent $44 on these gloves that lasted 2 months (oct-dec) and all I do is boxing/circuit classes twice a week.

I'm just getting into boxing at home and wanted to find something cheap, but with decent quality.I came across both sets of the gloves shown in the photo on Amazon.It turns out that both gloves are branded by ""Fiving"".As photos don't do justice for some items sold online, I couldn't choose between the two.So I bought both.The other set of gloves (ASIN B0BRR7RHL7) are new on Amazon, have no reviews, but look very similar.Had I of not purchased both sets of these gloves at the same time, I doubt I may have noticed and or pointed out the things I'm going to point out.So my review is going to seem a bit comparativebetween the two.Anyhow, the gloves for this listing are much more bulkier than the other gloves.Since I'm just starting out, I wanted to opt for something that doesn't look huge on my hands, while still getting the job done.Another thing I noticed was the gloves on this listing have a much longer pocket for your fingers.So when putting them on, you feel like you have to really push your fingers into the glove to fill out the length of the pocket if that makes sense.You're essentially having to curve your fingers more into the glove to make the fit feel more comfortable.Although both of the gloves have the same width velcro straps, the ones on this listing have a much wider velcro strip on the glove itself.The gloves on this listing are also not as round looking as the other gloves and seem a bit flat.Although both sets of gloves have breathable mesh within the palm area of the glove, the other gloves have a much wider mesh for air flow.I can only assume that the other gloves are a newer model of these.Not sure.Anyhow, see my video comparing the two side by side."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.730700

The material on the outside also appears to be thin.They do look great and I was excited about using them, but the knuckle pain was too much to ignore. Even after giving 2 weeks between sessions, the pain would come back. I have Fairtex brand shin guards as well and they set to be well-made. Really disappointed, especially after reading the great reviews from everyone.I tried different hand wraps, quick wraps, extra wrapping, etc before switching away from these.I ended up buying the Hayabusa T3 Boxing Gloves to replace these along with extra long gold brand wraps, and there was a immediate difference, no more knuckle pain, even after doing multiple sessions a week.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.730769

One of the things that sets these apart from many other gloves is their shape. Many gloves have a sort if lightbulb shape to them, rounded around the knuckles. Fairtex gloves are more flat across the knuckles, giving an evenly distributed amount of padding across the hand.Their padding is also dense. This has 2 advantages:1. The gloves are more compact, so during sparring they can slip through guards a bit easier.2. They have a very satisfying sound and feel while hitting mitts and bags compared to more squishy gloves on the market.I have other gloves as well. I really like my Boon gloves. But overall, there’s really no need to use anything but Fairtex unless you’re going to be fighting with gloves specified by an organization and want to train in the same gloves you’ll fight in.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.730781

I don't fight professionally; I just enjoy doing heavy bag and mit work. Prior to purchasing these gloves, I owned Twins Special 16oz boxing gloves. Those suckers lasted me about 8 years and counting. Because this Thailand-based company is going through some legal battle with the Twins franchise in the States, I can no longer purchase these gloves. (I even tried locating a store in Thailand- who said they can no longer sell them). If anyone has used this brand before, they will know how durable and padded the gloves are.I had purchased these gloves, since I am familiar with the Fairtex brand and other products. When I received them, I tried them on and was immediately disappointed. It had a weird cardboard-like feel to them and barely any cushion. Even the ""Genuine Leather"" felt off to me. I have tried researching for many months and have found many people say these BGV1 gloves are ""cushioned"" well and great quality. These gloves, however, did not feel great. In fact, they felt like any ordinary basic glove you can get from random HIIT boxing gyms or DICKS Sporting goods. I would suggest these gloves for beginners- but I would think beginners would need more cushion as well in order to avoid injury to their hands.As much as it hurts me to say, this wasn't a good fit for me. If you're looking for something with more cushion, protection, and durability, then I wouldn't suggest purchasing this item."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.730823

It only slightly impacts my ability to open the glove up during clinching, catching kicks, etc.Otherwise these gloves are super tough, not bulky looking, and the stitching and velcro are heavy duty.

I used venum elite for a couple of years and now using Hayabusa T3 for bag work and sparring. I realize there's a big pricepoint difference between the Hayabusas and these fairtex but these gloves just feel very barebone. I can use the T3s and not wrap my hands if Im feeling lazy and the wrist support and padding do a lot of the heavy lifting - even when im going 100% on a heavy bag. With these gloves i feel like you have to wrap your hands even for light to medium work.Also I dont have large hands (5'9 165lb) and my hands are swimming in the 16 oz gloves. Its not a huge deal b/c these were relatively cheap gloves but if you're in the $70-$100 price range, i'd probably look at something else.Edit:No idea how this glove is coming apart this quickly but I’m not exactly Mike Tyson so these things should not be imploding.These gloves are in use maybe 3 times a week for an hour a day at most and I rotate them with another pair to let them dry out.Never buying another pair of fairtex gloves again.

I'm a boxing dummy so I wouldn't know if gloves were counterfeit or not. I mean, as long as they look and work like them, I'm good to go. They did come very quickly but as soon as I opened the package, I knew that I didn't like them. The wrist area was all scrunched under the velcro. Also, despite being 16 oz gloves, they didn't feel like they have the heft. I weighted them and they were indeed 16oz. The major sheen on them were also a turn off so back they went!

They're a little on the tight side the first time you use them; when you're putting them on you'll want to make sure that your fingers get ALL THE WAY to the end of the glove. That might sound obvious but it is something I haven't had to be conscious of in the past. With the way these gloves are shaped (I assume with a focus on both striking and clenching) they feel a lot more open in the fingers than gloves I've had before and if you don't push your fingers all the way down to the end of the glove you end up striking and hitting with your fingers before your knuckles. Once you do get your fingers all the way in, you'll strike with your knuckles much easier, it is just something to be aware of.In the past I've always worked with 16oz gloves, this time I decided to go with a set of 14oz gloves to give me a smaller glove profile so that in sparring I can land some of my flashier shots that just don't work in big bulky gloves. They're definitely smaller, and I really like that. The construction seems solid, the leather is definitely genuine. The padding is hard. There's little support in the wrists so be ready to wrap your wrists extra to compensate for that.Knuckle Pads will fit inside the glove if you have smaller hands but you'll want to spend the time to break in the gloves before using them or your hands will really hurt.I will update after a while of use and let you know how they're holding up.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.731058

I've been wrapping my hands in the same manner as before, but have had knuckle & palm pain in both hands more now with this Fairtex set of glovesConclusion:The lack of padding is noticeable and the pain i'm feeling isn't acceptable.I'll definitely be switching over to the Rival Guerrero's to give them a try after this pair.Honestly, am debating whether to continue even using these anymore.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.731098

I bought these as my old gloves had already gone way past their life cycle. These are short-cuffed, so if you are looking for a boxing glove specifically, I'd recommend you to take a look at the BGV9's as those offer better wrist support and are more compact. That being said, if you practice muay thai these are amazing. The stitching is spot on, very impressive. They have a lovely smell of leather and are also comfortable. Because of their purpose, the BGV1's will allow some wrist movement (meant for the clinch), do be mindful of that, they still have good wrist support but you have to be conscious. They're also roomy inside which is not an issue for me (I'm 6'1 but have tiny hands, used to perceiving gloves as roomy).I bought mine in the ""Falcon Gold"" version if that is useful in any way."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.731137

(but you should!)|I cannot rave enough about how much I love these gloves. They are the coolest looking gloves in my favorite color and it is an incredible UPGRADE from the crappy everlast I've been using for a year. It is excelled for sparring, bags, conditioning etc. It is such high quality that I needed quite a few conditioning rounds and thickened wraps to break them in. The velcro straps are extremely sticky so sometimes it's difficult when I already have a glove on one hand because it goes all the way around your wrist. My left is just a tiny bit more loose than my right hand and I'm okay with that. I absolutely love these gloves.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.731346

I also wanted a muay thai brand vs an mma brand. However these were missing a ""Grip Bar"" that many newer gloves have. This seems to make the fist more solid and offers more protection from the hand compressing during harder strikes. The velcro wrist wrap was not able to be tight enough for me, even with handwraps on, and I was able to pull my fist out too easily. I ended up deciding to sell these shortly after I bought them."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.731348

Fairtex power gauntlets.|These are the best boxing or kickboxing gloves ive ever had. 100% I hate boxing style gloves for a few reasons.They are oddly weighted which changes the dynamic of punching.The excessive padding makes it impossible to properly land with your knuckles.They force you to punch with an open hand because theyre hard to close.The excessive padding leads you to lower the impulse of your punches and opt for more of a pushing force to bypass the padding. This leads to unnatural punching technique when bare knuckle fighting.These fairtex joints right here have none of those problems. They wear like an mma glove, very light to the front. All of the weight is distributed towards the wrist so they have an evenly weighted feel and dont throw off punch trajectory. Its like a wall hanger sword versus a well weighted straight sword.The padding on the knuckles is dense but not very thick so you can manage to aim with your knuckles. The punching surface is slightly flattened right at the knuckles. You also dont need to push your punches as much.The gloves open and close quite easily. Easily enough that its no large feat to catch or parry punches and high kicks.Compared to brands like title everlast and throwdown, the 3 brands ive used in the past, these things are like having laser guided missiles for hands! Its like they stabilise in flight. Its a cooky feeling.its awesome though. Theyre like okamoto crown condoms... The closest thing to nothing at all haha. Once i wear through these, or iwant to change my gym gear color scheme, im definitely looking at Fairtex first. And you should too.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.731363

They fit well and the wrist protection is firm and solid. I always wear hand wraps and would definitely recommend wraps with these gloves when breaking them in. I train Muay Thai 3-4 times a week and have a background in amateur olympic style Western boxing. In comparison with other gloves I've tried at various gyms, such as TITLE Classic Pro Style synthetic 16 oz or Everlast MMA 12 oz, I like the wrist protection, padding and firmness of these gloves. Also, these are not as big and clumsy as TITLE gloves. It's worth to invest a few extra bucks in a pair of gloves that will last long, instead of buying cheap ones and taking the risk of injuring the wrist or the knuckles. It's the same as when you buy shoes: they need to fit well. That's why I bought these.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.731373

I've been using these gloves since a year now, but alternating with a pair of 16 oz twins gloves, and now i can write a good review on them. First of all, the leather is great, i know i will be using these gloves for another year for sure, maybe more. Some people say that they stink because they are fully closed and don't have any type of ventilation, that is not true, it doesn't affect anything. However, the one thing that i can complain about is that they are small for 16 oz gloves, and on top of that, they are pretty big on the inside of the glove. There is too much space for the hand, so you have to wrap pretty good your hands before using them because otherwise your hand will be dancing around. Maybe one or two sets of wraps per hand, depending on the size of the hand. This has an explanation though, these are MUAY THAI gloves, not boxing gloves. You need to have that extra space inside the glove so you can grab propperly in the clinch. But if you like to use them for kick boxing sparring only, these are not the best gloves for you, and for your partner, cause they don't have too much padding. I love them. But i only use them when i do straight muay thai, for kick boxing i use my 16 oz Twins gloves. Also, it would be great if they came in some case or something.

I was an mma fighter for a few years and currently train a few times a week to keep in shape.I love these gloves. They are made out of quality material, have enough padding and is really an excellent product. They are the most comfortable gloves I've had. They take a week or so to break in as they come pretty stiff as new but once you use them for a few sessions you should be good. I've had them for about 2 months now and they are holding up really well, everything from the stitching, to the logo, and the velcro. The only thing that keeps it from getting 5 stars is that they are very short and does not do a great job at protecting the wrists which can become a problem when working on power on heavy bags.Other than that I would definitely recommend these gloves to people that have been boxing for a while, not so much to newbies as the lack of wrist protection may cause problems.

The smell on those RDX gloves really is that of a premium leather, it smells fantastic. It seems these Fairtex gloves don't really have a smell of leather at all! I know they state that they are genuine leather in the description, which I don't doubt, however I suppose I was hoping to have that really premium smell.

They are dense, and feel very good when delivering punches. These may not be ideal for hard contact sparring if people are throwing full-power bombs to knock each other out (why people? why?!?), as they are not going to absorb as much shock as other puffier gloves.Fairtex has a very solid reputation which absolutely holds up in my experience with this product.

I've been really putting them to the test with lots of bag/pad work and the quality has been amazing so far! I really like the support the gloves give you on the knuckles.

I bought two pairs (10oz and 16oz) almost 10 years ago and finally decided to replace the 10's. However, not because they're damaged, but I left them in the gym bag one too many times and they started to stink. If it wasn't for that, they're still in very good shape. I've been training very regularly for the last 9-10 years, averaging about 3x per week. No point in getting the cheap stuff that falls apart in less than a year, these last forever. Looking forward to another 10 years with these - this time I'll hang them on the outside of my gym bag.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.731633

I didn't realize that these were a ""tight-fit"" type of manufacturing. There is still padding when I strike, but the padding seemed significantly more compressed. When I spar I need to use my older gloves just so that I can be sure I don't hurt anyone.I think that when the gloves just say ""16"" instead of ""16oz"" it means that ""16' is a tight-fit manufactured style. It feels more shaped to my fist than my old everlast gloves. I love the wrist velcro as it wraps around and provides a lot of wrist support. It doesn't have as much knuckle padding as I'm used to, I will need to change the way I wrap my hands (more padding on my knuckles)read this guy's review here:http://muaythaipros.com/fairtex-muay-thai-gloves-review-tight-fit-16-oz/"|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.731689

I do one hour bag classes (kick boxing, trigger point, and boxing on a hanging 150lb bag) 3-4 times a week.Out of the box I can already tell a hug difference with material, stitching, and just make of the gloves. The padding seems a lot more durable thickness then the everlast that was easily pushed down. My knuckles run 3 inches length from pointer finger to pinky,and my wrists are 2 inches long. So having a smaller hand size these 14oz gloves ran snug on me. I had to use them without any wraps for about 4 or 5 one hour classes before I had enough room for my hands with wraps on them. Striking without wraps were amazing, I could barely tell any impact on my knuckles like I could with the everlast gloves. The velcro for the straps ran a little big because they are new, and I have small wrists. When I have wraps on my hands they take up a lot of the play and are very snug for support and striking. All together I love these gloves.I haven't used them for sparing, just striking pads and heavy bag.For the new people looking to start bag work, I say get these gloves!! You might want to use the cheaper ones to save money, but the more you take classes the harder your going to strike. Save yourself the time and hassle and spend a little extra to get mid range gloves like these, you'll thank yourself in the long run.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.731769

When these arrived I immediately noticed the color of the packaging and the gloves themselves seemed washed out and faded. I tried them on and they barely even fit. The padding inside was all bunched up, preventing my fingers from fitting in their intended spot, and the thumb section was so short my thumb didn't even fit. The elastic on the underside that stretches to allow your palm to fit barely even stretched. There was no chance of them fitting with my hand wraps on. I went back to the retail store and tried them on again and sure enough they fit perfectly and the color of the gloves was way brighter than these. I don't know what the deal with these gloves are, if they're defects, knock offs, or smaller sizes incorrectly packaged as a larger size.

This is my 3rd gloves over 5 years. Overall the glove is ok however the section from the base of the thumb at wrist is too short and so not as comfortable. I wondered if it was my imagination however I measured it with my Everlast Glove,which is more comfortable, and found that it was shorter.

I have used these for a few years before being gifted a pair of leather Hayabusa T3's (by far the best gloves I've tried out) I would recommend these for anyone more seasoned and serious as the price is almost 7x the price of these. ($200)These are good quality and padding for the cost.I have smaller hands so the felt a little big inside but most gloves are similar sized so not that big of a deal. I would suggest when warping your hands to properly wrap your wrists as there isn't too much extra support as others have stated, on some of my harder punches I could feel it on my wrists.again these are great for beginners esp if you are wanting better quality for a cheaper price than others around 60+ range|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.732050

I ordered these as well as one by AlphaForce as the grip shapes were slightly different, both in 14oz. I didnt base my purchase on weight/height scale but what the instructor recommended, which was likely similar anyway. These gloves were great and absorbed the impact on the heavybag, comfortable inside, and also look great (I got black and gold?metallic).The ventilation in the palms is alright, personally I think I'd need more because my hands get pretty hot when in class.

The pinky is very weird, but I guess you can get used to it.During the break-in process, be sure to tape your fingers if you notice them rubbing against the inside of the glove, you can have some nasty strawberry’s on your fingers that take a while to heal and can prevent you from boxing. To be more clear it’s the parts of your fingers that are exposed after you wrap your hands. I use hyabusha knuckle guards under my wrap, and had been doing knuckle push-ups to strengthen my wrists, so the gloves did me well in terms of protection on top of the wrap.Overall it’s not terrible, but not awesome either.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.732139

I wasn’t able to get them to all come out until after my 2nd time wearing them. Also my hands started to get really sore after about 30 minutes, and mind you I’m no beginner.

I noticed that most gloves (even expensive ones) seemed to thin out too much over the knuckles. My best find was an old, 6+ yr old pair of Title Classics that had a ton of knuckle padding, but then I got ahold of a new pair of classics and it was nowhere near the same.

It sucks because I was really excited when these arrived in the mail and I was planning on passing along my old gloves to my brother. Speaking of those old gloves…they were Venum gloves and they’re far more comfortable than these ones.

user|R6OSEXH8IM61A|B0773RHLRX||Tina Liouzis|2|February 3, 2023|1675389600|Disappointing fit|I use Sanabul wraps and protective gear for kickboxing, and the quality is fantastic. I needed new gloves and chose Sanabul, expecting matching quality with their gloves, but I was disappointed.The gloves were different weights from each other, and it was noticeable during my striking. That’s why I weighed them when I came home. The gloves are super stiff with limited wrist support, yet they were quite tight inside. I expect a break in period with new gloves, but they shouldn’t pinch my fingers. The left glove was tighter than the right and it was oddly stitched inside. My left index finger was very compressed and the glove seemed shorter in that spot. I’m a 5’1” female (155 cm) with small hands. Ring size is 5, wrists are 5.5” (14 cm). These felt like children’s gloves on the inside. I wrapped my hands, and I only use 120” wraps - not 180’s, and I could barely squeeze my hands inside. I can’t imagine how a male with wraps could use these.I quickly returned them and took a chance on the Venum Elite 12 oz. Wow, they are perfect. The fit is excellent, the padding is perfect, the wrist support is spot-on, and they required no break in period. I probably received a badly manufactured pair of gloves from Sanabul, but I’m glad I did because I wouldn’t have tried the Venums if I hadn’t.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.732229

My hands are medium sized and with wraps most gloves fit snug and I got the 16 oz. These fit snug around the palms, but lacks starts slacking at the knuckles to the tip of the finger tips. Around the knuckle the padding is off and awkward. Very lose around my ""second"" knuckle so it will tear off skin for heavy hitters. Super tight at the tip of fingers like it was made shorter than intended. I wouldn't recommend for the enthused and heavy hitters. Great for budget minded and just boxercise. My fellow fighters, look elsewhere."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.732405
user|R2X59YGOM9E11V|B0773RHLRX|B06ZZZJ93C|Joshua|3|August 18, 2022|1660788000|cheap but not very supportive|I bought 6 gloves for comparison. Ranked from best to worst for my criteria:1. Hayabusa T3 - ($150) Very well designed. the double velcro closure is the best closure system i've personally used.It has foam splints which both helps prevent unwanted wrist alignment if you fudge a hook and also from blocking hooks.Foam feels really good (14oz), enough protection and not like hitting with a pillow.I ultimately chose to keep this glove because of it's superior wrist support, which is specifically important to me due to recurring wrist issues.2. Hayabusa H5 - ($100) It's got a single strap closure, but the fact that it's partially elasticized makes it easy to get a secure closure on it.Foam feels pretty similar to the T3.The wrist splits seem to be only slightly less affective.overall i think this glove is a very high value.3. Hayabusa T3 LX - ($200) pretty much identical to the T3 but with leather.The colors are simple but elegant.I'm only rating this lower than the above because i think the $200 price tag lowers the value quite a bit.4. Hayabusa S4 ($50) - better wrist support then the below options, but the materials and fit definitely feel sub par to the above models.What really turned me off on this model is that the wrist closure just fits oddly, almost rectangular feeling.5. Sannabul Essentials Gel - very inexpensive.The materials and don't seem that bad, but the fit isn't as secure as i'd like.. literally no wrist support, you can just fold the glove in half at the wrist.6. Venom Elite -pretty much same deal as the sannabul but more expensive.Other notes, these gloves will last most people years and i think it's worth spending $100+ for some support and quality.I'd highly recommend you try the T3 but if you want a $100 cap i would go for the H5 or a good old pair of twins special gloves (which i've gone through three pairs of over the last 15 years). happy striking.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.732408

A few hits won't hurt, but someone with a high striking rate will start feeling it in a session. I have bruised my knuckles multiple times using this glove.

user|R1BI6FS82RE42Z|B0773RHLRX||Simon Yang|4|April 20, 2022|1650420000|Safe option for beginners|I needed some gloves to tied me over until the end of the semester. I got these because they were relatively cheap and had decent reviews. After trying it for a couple practices I will say that they work. They protect your hands well. First impression though, there is a chemically paint smell that lingers for a few days. I think the odor will fade over time but it was pretty overbearing when I first opened the gloves up.In terms of fit, the hand part is on the snug side(which I like because I have small hands) but the opening of the glove is wide (which is weird as you would need small hands and a really large forearm to fit this glove) and it doesn't have elastic straps so it doesn't offer much wrist support and you will have to rely entirely on your wraps for that.Also, I think there is a small mistake on the seam inside where they sealed a bit too much of the material off near the pinky on the right side. My glove fits my hands well on the left hand but for the right the pinky is kind of being squeezed.In terms of impact, the glove felt a tad stiff, but I can hit the bag decently hard and feel protected, not sure how the material will hold up over time but for these couple practices they worked well.Overall, since they are only $30, I would recommend these to beginners that are just starting and not sure they will stick with boxing long term. They will definitely do the job until you decent to invest more into the sport.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.732702

If you feel any discomfort and you dont compete, get your hands looked at. Im looking for a good pair of hand wraps. Can anyone recommend a pair, gloves rather than wraps.

user|R20OP3U9POOQ7Q|B0773RHLRX||W-NY|5|April 16, 2022|1650074400|Great gloves|I have a free standing heavy bag at home. My husband purchased a 12 oz pair for me last year for my cardio boxing. I’m on the bag 4-5 times a week for 30 min to an hour each time. I noticed my knuckles would ache a little after each workout and would ache at night if I tried making a fist. I thought it was just something that happens. I decided to try the 16 oz. To see if it would help my knuckles. It helped! I don’t feel any pain with the harder punches and my knuckles don’t hurt anymore!I do wear gel hand wraps with the gloves. The 12 oz was recommended for my ‘size’, but the 16 oz is so much kinder to my knuckles.I expected the 16 oz to fit on the larger size, but it seems to fit the same as the 12 oz when the 12 oz gloves were new. The weight difference doesn’t bother me. It’s only a 4 oz difference and when I’m punching, I can’t tell the difference.My 12 oz was ordered as pink, but I received the fluorescent greenish yellow. I liked the color so I kept it.16oz. Ordered as orange (pink was not available). It too is a fluorescent color, not a regular orange as I was expecting. It was a nice surprise.They are easy on/off. Velcro around the wrist stays nice and snug. My hands sweat in them. Just wipe them out with a Clorox wipe.Great gloves and I will be back again for a pair in a different color to have as a backup.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.732715

user|R2FYCP6RF371JW|B0773RHLRX||Sean|2|March 11, 2022|1646964000|Loose and uncomfortable|My first pair of gloves were Everlast Pros (not elite, which are somehow worse), which I thought were fine, but I wanted to try a different pair. I bought these after watching a YouTube review and returned them to Amazon after one heavy bag session. They fit too loose even with wraps on, and lack comfort for the impact side of your hand. There is plenty of padding on the outside, but the inside of the glove abused hands during hard hooks. I felt like my hands got beat up just as much as the heavy bag, whereas the Everlast Pros felt much more comfortable and tighter while providing the same amount of protection.Lesson learned. Ordered another pair of the Everlast Pros and plan on sticking with them. Don’t fix what ain’t broken 🤷‍♂️|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.732748

The wrap around wrist Velcro is very good and holds tight. The big issue I have is the padding. It is not consistent on the left glove and hurts my knuckles. I thought at first it was me with bad technique, or bad wrapping, but after my coach lend me another pair of gloves the difference on the padding was huge. Too bad it is too late for me to return.

Maybe if you fix the issue I would love to but a new pair or trade mine in.I think the glove is a great product. I have been boxing for a lot of years so my hands take a pounding and I can feel the difference between a good glove or not. The knuckle protection is wonderful and the weight is superb. It can almost compete with those expensive comptetion glove companies.The only thing I have an issue with, is the unnecessary pading in the inside of the glove, where your hand folds. It seems there is some gel like cylinder sewed inbetween the fabric.That thing needs to come out and there should be little to no padding at all. This glove may be good to a person who does not wear handwraps, But with the extra padding inside the hand caused by the handwraps, it causes the hand to make impact at an angle. Almost like punching with a half closed fist. This causes extreme discomfort and pain after only the first 45min of training. I train for hours sometimes and at first I thought it was just me, but then I took off the gloves. I went an extra hour without the gloves,just pure handwraps and the pain was gone.I also compared it with other gloves I had and i found the culprit. It is that little useless gel cylinder you have sewed in, where the hand folds.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.732804

I am a novice kickboxer- I use these gloves for kickboxing and light boxing workouts. They are large enough I can get my hands inside without undoing the Velcro, once my hands are in they are a comfortable fit. They do get sweaty inside-to be expected . I open them up and dry them out after each workout. No problems with these gloves. I would recommend them.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.732810

People that say they rub/cut from inside the glove is because they are not curling up their fist correctly. I felt it at first on the left hand glove but you have to fully insert your hand and make sure your fingers curl up past the seam. Otherwise when new, your pinky rubs for some reason. These gloves are light, look good and feel great!|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.732820

I used them almost every day for my title boxing classes.These are the 2nd pair of gloves I've ever owned. I used the AK-47 Muay Thai style 16 oz gloves before this until they got ripped. Decided to try these because of the reviews and 30 dollar price point.I gave 3 stars because of the 30 dollar price point.I'm 5' 6"" and I have medium sized hands, and these feel too tight for my hands. I wanted to try them for a week or two thinking they would loosen up. After doing that, I can now say these are still a tight fit. These are the 16 oz gloves.First day of using them, I got ""gloves bite"" on my right pinky finger (see the photo) kind of like a new shoe bite experience to the back of the ankle. I had to use the hand wraps as a shield on my pinky for the next 2 days.I hit the bag hard with my hands. I got these gloves after using my old AK-47gloves (which were 3 years old, to begin with) for about a month of title boxing classes. So this is my second month that I needed these gloves for...and this whole week of using them, I feel pain in my wrist area, back of the palm area, and my left shoulder area, the day after the class has finished. This didn't happen with my older gloves. I can feel the padding being inadequate when I'm throwing hard hooks to the bag.I also observed (from the first day itself) that the stitching lines on the right glove are not proper. There's an overlap of patches of leather (see the close-up photos) where the lines meet. For 30 dollars this is probably expected, but I feel like this is a basic level detail that I observed and wanted to bring it up.As I said I got these because of the reviews, and the price point. Didn't feel like neither were justified because bottom line they need to at least have protection to prevent post-workout pain if not anything else."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.732965

They feel comfortable and not pinching or scruffy inside the glove to you hands. The one con I have is that they wore out pretty fast. I did bag work everyday for almost 4 months and by now the inside foam has almost all fell out of the glove resulting in there being almost no padding left. Only on my right hand this happened (power hand) it leaked out slowly and fell out with each punch also the inside nylon fiber came apart and makes it so my fist rested against the bare foam padding probably making the leakage faster.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.733107

I ordered these gloves just over a month ago because of the fair price and review quality. I rated 3 stars because you get what you pay for. They are not terrible but they are NOT BREATHABLE whatsoever. My hands are absolutely drenched in sweat after my 1 hour workout so they already smell horrible. I even keep the Velcro wrist open after my workout to help air them out to dry, and they still feel moist (I hate that word) the following 2 days when I return. Also, yesterday I noticed the lining on the inside already had a small rip. The wrist protection is also not great and most days I leave with them feeling pretty sore and stiff.I just hate the fact that I am now just 3 days too late to do a return on them.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.733260

Easy to put on, easy to make a fist, comfortable, easy to fasten for wrist protection, durable, break in period is very short. Only reason Im not giving this 5 stars is because of the quality control on my 12oz gloves. It seemed as if the inner workings of the glove were sticking out on the outside of the gloves between the stitches. As if they forgot to cut the measurements from the inside before stitching the gloves together. Had to use a precision knife to cut around the edges of the outside. Other than that, the glove looks normal now and still functions as it should. The 16oz gloves were fine so must've been a fluke on the 12oz. My issue is only about the cosmetics not the applicability of the 12oz gloves. I expect to have these gloves for a long time.

For any beginners that aren't familiar with the differences in boxing gloves, if you're going to be sparring, you don't want to get the super cheap gloves that are only meant for bag work. Some of those bag work gloves have material like stitching on areas of the glove near the wrist that if it rubs on your sparring partners face will scratch or cut them and your sparring partner will not be happy. I think for any hobbyist that is going to be sparring these are great gloves. They support your wrists well, they're durable, they look good, they're comfortable.

The imf tech within the padding takes some bluntness out of your punches, which is good for sparring. However this lacks wrist support, which is crucial for a daily driver or intense use.

Those were garbage and a teammate recommended ringside. I've bought one pair of ringside gloves before that were pretty good but I wanted a pair with more cushion. These delivered. My hands feel very comfortable when hitting the bag and the protection is great for me on the bag and whilst sparring for my partners. The stability of the gloves is nice too. That said, if you're in desperate need of wrist support, these aren't the perfect brand but they absolutely do a great job if you're throwing with proper technique. That said, the weight distribution is a tad front-heavy so that takes some getting used to but I'd say it helps conditioning overall. The color has faded after a bit but that happens with almost any glove when you're hitting a bag thousands of times a week. Final score = 9.5/10.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.733398

I'm 6'9"" 235lbs former athlete and I needed the gloves that I can squeeze my big hands in. First time was kind of tough, I needed to do it with my wife's help. The more you use and break them in, it becomes easier to get in. Absorbs punches very well - I am a heavyweight and hit the bag quite hard. Just make sure you wrap your hands properly, but that goes for any gloves. Do not punch without wrapping, or you will be going to the ER (especially if you are just starting to box). A bit too shiny for the looks, but whatever - it was a good price. I would recommend to others."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.733508

Good gloves for beginners & hitting a heavy bag.|I've only ever used the Ringside Apex Flash Sparring Gloves to hit a heavy bag, but I do like them. The 16-ounce gloves are sufficiently padded and fit well (not too tight, but definitely not too big either) and the velcro hook and loop wrap-around closures keep the gloves secure, no matter how hard you're hitting, but still make taking the gloves off a whole lot easier than some of the other closures out there (hook and loop or otherwise). Wrist support seems pretty good and should offer enough protection as long as your throwing your punches properly (something I don't always do). They seem very durable, with no rips, tears or stitching giving way, and with only the natural wear of the outer design showing that they've been used.For the price, these Ringside Apex sparring gloves are hard to beat. For a beginner, they look and feel like the real deal, and while they won't last forever, they look and (mostly) act the part. If you're just looking for a pair of gloves to hit a heavy bag, these definitely did the job for me.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.733526

However, after buying a few different pairs of gloves, I resolved that they will all be tight when they are new. So I took 2 small wash cloths and stuffed one in each glove, to help the gloves expand faster. It definitely worked, because I was able to use the gloves with wraps without my circulation being cut off lol. Unfortunately I can't remember how long it took for this to work (at least a week or so) but would suggest trying this if you like your gloves but they're too tight. But, I love these gloves and am very satisfied! I don't box that often ( 2-3 times a month) but I have 2 pairs of gloves, and I'm always wearing these!|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.733589

A little snug if you don't have small boy hands. Not much padding either. Other than that, I mean, they look cool. Mainly the gloves are good for sparring, (I know they're sparring gloves)they do not feel good for bag work, incase you were wondering. However even when sparring, I don't really like the way the glove is rounded at the end and the way feels when I make contact.Now the pros, I like how even they feel with the weight distribution, and they feel light. I love the way they look, and I do believe they are decent sparring gloves overall.

Solid craftmanship and TONS of padding on the knuckles, just as advertised. Feels super cushy and yet still generates a powerful punch. Material inside, the lining, is a bit different than most I've tried, and I do find that it makes my hands sweat a lot more than usual. The tight wrist support also adds to that (in this case in a good way since you get good stability), but after a session it feels like I just took my hand out of a bucket of water.

Kept training until one day the inside seam busted and starting putting styrofoam padding all over the place. At this time it had only been 6 months since I got the gloves. I’m not bashing the gloves good to start out with just know you will need a new pair very soon. I’d honestly spend the money and buy something better then these Hyabusa, Twins or even Yokkao (if your order straight from them it will take bit to get them because they are hand made from Thailand) but well worth it. When I called Ringside all they said was there is 120 day warranty on them and there was nothing they could do. Understandable.

The Ringside Apex Flash Sparring Gloves not only keep your hand protected, but add a little sizzle with “flash” styling.These sparring-quality gloves are made with a special Injected Molded Foam process to create a single 2” layer of protective foam, giving your hand more protection and lasting longer than layered foam gloves. The synthetic leather shell is easy to clean. Note that the thumb is attached to the fingers for safety, so these gloves are really only meant for boxing. The breathable palm mesh and perforations help keep the gloves ventilated. The gloves also have grip bars to help you make a tight fist.The gloves have hook and loop wrist wraps to keep your gloves in place and help provide wrist support. I found these gloves to have a snug fit, but they are perfect for my wife–be sure you get the right size. The 14 oz gloves are recommended for those up to 5’ 8” tall or who weigh less than 150 pounds; the 16 oz gloves are recommended for those taller than 5’ 8” or who weigh more than 150 pounds.All in all, these are very nice gloves.

Specifically when I'm using them for heavy bag workouts, in orthodox my right knuckle is getting sore in 1 round. It actually feels like if I'm stupid and hit the heavy bag with 12oz gloves. This might be fit, might just need breaking in or they might be REALLY tailored for sparring since they are marketed as such. I'll give them a little time.Anyway, they seem to be a good value.

The internal padding works really well and my hands feel very protected. I do clean these after every session, but worth noting that they don't seem to retain the workout smell. User notes: I am a medium build female with medium-large size hands. These are a bit big on me, but not so much that they're unusable. The padding also takes quite a bit of wearing in before you can easily pull your wrapped hand in and out.

Feels very small with big hands.|"The material holds up well, and all in all for the price they are suitable probably for most people. However I do have larger hands and these seem to run fairly small. It is a very tight squeeze even after getting broken in, but more importantly length wise my fingertips are pushing against the very end of the glove, even stretching the material around them any time I make a fist. They are fairly uncomfortable even after a few months of use. I am 6'4"" 207lbs so these will probably be amazing gloves for a more average sized person, but if you have big, long hands these may not be the gloves for you. I am dealing with them hoping I can break them in to the point of some comfort, but if you are any larger than I am I just have to say I can't recommend them. They almost feel like they could be youth-adolescent sized but I don't see that listed on the description. I wish I could have tried them on because I was able to notice all of my issues with the glove the first time I put them on, but that just doesn't work for online shopping, which is why I am still giving 4 stars. The gloves are durable and don't have any ripping or tearing or wear after many hours on the heavy bag and mitts.TL;DR - IF you aren't a person with large hands, these are exceptional gloves. If you are, expect discomfort, and a long, possibly infinite, break-in period."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.733865

It provides great padding and resistance, but, because of the extra distance from the knuckle to the exterior of the glove, it took a little while to get used to. I, personally, believe that it also provides a little bit of a rebound effect that offers resistance and might be helping me punch through my target a little more. Once I got used to it, anyway.I also have a pair of Ringside Lace IMF Tech Boxing Kickboxing Muay Thai Training Gloves Sparring Punching Mitts. Although I really enjoy the classic look of the lace-ups, the Velcro-style wrist wrap on the Apex gloves enables me to easily put the gloves on and take them off when no one else is around to help me out. Believe it or not, I also feel like the Velcro-style closure provides a tighter and more secure fit.While I’m comparing the two sets, I’ll also say that the vented palm on the Apex gloves does breathe surprisingly well. Additionally, the lace-ups have a lining that tends to stick to the skin when the sweat is flowing, which actually did a number on my fingers below the wrap. The Apex gloves, however, have a lining that is soft and cotton-like; sticking is not an issue.All in all, these are great gloves. I really enjoy them. If you are trying to decide between the Ringside Apex or Lace-ups, I would recommend the Apex – unless you need lace-ups, of course.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.733972

I can't attest to using these in a pro boxing manner, butI enjoy hitting a reflex bag that I've set up in my garage for some extra exercise, and these work perfectly. The fit is great on my hands and they don't slip around or slide as I'm punching the bag. They wrap securely around my wrists which increases their stability and keeps my wrists stable while punching the bag. Overall the quality seems excellent. The leather and the stitching seems very high quality and like they will last for a very long time, especially for the type of use I'm giving them. Your hand will always get sweaty in boxing gloves, but these gloves seem to wick moisture and keep my hands cooler and dryer than gloves I've used in the past. These is a lot of padding in the knuckle area which really helps to protect my hands and keep them from getting too tired over a long session.

Most importantly, they were fairly comfortable right from the box. With the construction of glove’s padding, they are not supposed to have a break-in requirement. I think they are getting more comfortable as I use them but I suppose it could just be a reaction because they are new-to-me. The injected molded foam (IMF) padding is 2.25” thick in the molded construction of the Apex Flash glove. I think they feel well on the strikes and light back-and-forth for fitness workouts I do.The outside feels like a quality, albeit synthetic leather, that rivals other brands I have used. I have the red/white which features additional gold trim and accents on the thumb and under the finger compartment. If you want full grain leather, Ringside has the Predator model among others.Of the discrepancies from other models I’ve used, my other gloves feature a double-adjustable wrist wrap, which is great for a more supportive fit for me. These Apex gloves include a fairly long 3.5” wrap around Velcro closure that still seems sufficient. However, my other gloves were also more expensive than the Apex. I would prioritize any key features among several gloves for your needs and comfort.Finally, on the matter of sizing, I do think they run a tad small, which works out great for me with smaller hands and with wraps. The size chart from Ringside recommends the 14oz. gloves for height 5’8” or less and less than 150lbs. The 16oz is for larger than those height/weight metrics according to Ringside (see photo).|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.733992

The mesh palm piece is a nice touch to keep your hands from getting super sweaty. If you plan on wearing any sort of wrap on your hands make sure you order a glove size that will accommodate this. These particular gloves seem to run a little small, so if you have larger hands, be aware. So far they've held up to daily workouts, but this is the first pair of Ringside gloves I've owned. Prior gloves have had problems with poor velcro closures that stopped sticking after about a month or splits/cracks would develop in the curved part of the glove due to too thin pleather. I'm hoping that the pleather on these gloves is thicker than previous pairs I've had. All-in-all, a decent set of sparring gloves that don't break the bank.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.733994

They worked fine, except they are a little bulky for my frame. I'm a female, 5'7"", ~120lbs, and when the gloves are on they reach a little over halfway down my arm. The problem was about six weeks after I bought them and started using them in class regularly the velcro patch on the left glove pulled away from the glove completely when taking them off. The force of the velcro on the strap actually pulled it off, and it's now barely held to the glove by two threads. It's not something that can be fixed, so now I have to look to purchase a different set for when these inevitably fail completely.

The first two sets of gloves were great, both 16oz and 12 oz, they lasted for almost 6 years. The most recent purchase i had was a disappointment, because they started to use a mesh material on the inside of the glove. This material doesn't have any support, the glove just moves around. This Apex glove has majority of leather on the inside of the palm, which provides support and quality. So happy with my purchase.Pros:The leather provides support and helps the glove from sliding up and down.

I Sparred with them around 5 times vigorously and can tell you that these gloves really are great quality for the price!For comfort I rate these gloves 4/5Everything about the inside of these gloves feel great on your hands! The lining is comfortable and the fit is very tight. The only gripe I have is with the area that encloses your fingertips. The fit on the fingertips is too tight and causes some discomfort, other than that, highly comfortable gloves.For durability I rate these gloves a 4/5After about 5 days of hard sparring, 2 of the stitchings came loose, the material is also not leather so we will see how they hold up, but other than that, very durable.For hand and wrist protection I rate these gloves 5/5!If you want gloves that will have a tight grip on your wrists and protect your hands with great padding look no further than these. The IMF technology that of these gloves are filled with is truly great for the price you pay for them. The locking on the wrist is also very well done with a full wrap around the completely and closes your wrist with a tight lock, overall one of the most protective gloves I've ever put on!For partner protection I write these gloves 5/5!Like I said above the IMF technology is a really great, especially for when you are punching your sparring partner the padding is loosely distributed and very springy. Every single one of my sparring partners noticed a significant difference in these gloves and how comfortable there were to get hit with. Overall, fantastic in this department.I rate the aesthetic of these gloves a 5/5!One of the main reasons I bought these gloves is because of the excellent job they did on the look. I'm usually not a fan of flashy colorful gloves but ringside nailed it on these ones! These gloves look even better in person because of the way they reflect the light and the texture of them.

The padding shifted when I would hit, my hands couldn't fit in the gloves with wraps which isn't good. The wrist support was so so. and the outside of the glove material is a cloth like substance. They look good but that's about as good as they get (for me). I only used them the once and immediately returned them.I can't give a review based on durability but, I was disappointed since my pair of ringside bag gloves held up well and gave good support.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.734105

Heavy bag, light sparring - they're perfect.I've seen some comments that these may not be a full 16 oz. I'm not sure about that.If so, I feel bad for sparring with these.Otherwise, they are awesome gloves. The foam padding over the fist is more than adequate to absorb a great deal of impact but still communicate the feel of a punch snapping vs pushing, landing vs glancing, etc.They're not so big that you can cover your whole face with one like some other of those big pillowy gloves.The wrist support is pretty solid when snugged down tight.EASY on and off, unlike all of these wacky X-closures and overlapping straps that you need an engineering degree to take off.Great, great gloves.I'll buy another pair if these ever give out (maybe not in ostentatious gold, though)|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.734110

I searched everywhere for nice but not to cheap gloves. I was going to buy some from my coach for 65 at the Boxing Gym but felt as they were way to much. So i searched for the gloves everyone had at my Gym and found these ringside 16oz. 16oz is the best Gloves especially since 16oz is the recommended weight size for sparring. ive had these for about 1 month or more and a little stitching is coming out but you can always sew it back on. If youre a heavy hitter and you do hit bags or spar often DO NOT expect these gloves to last forever. Just like anything else with heavy use, you wont expect it to last forever!! Be opened minded to these gloves before purchasing, and do some research or even ask people you box with what they recommend, because sometimes 2 cents from others really does help get you the best product that suits you.Now let me break down the Gloves. When the Gloves came in, i was shocked at how nice they were. Just looking at the gloves and unpacking fron the Plastic bag was amazing. You smell the synthetic leather and right when you put the gloves on the cushion inside the gloves are so nice and fresh. The Gap in betweent the top of your hand and wrist is flexible and isnt really an issue if you know how to throw punches. if you dont know how to throw punches right you will hurt your wrists and it takes very long to recover. The feel of these gloves are so nice, they feel long and the velcro is v nice. Ive sparred about 8-10 times with these gloves since jve had them and since theyre 16oz they really do help with speed. I do recommend the Gloves to Beginners that want to take the Sport serious and training serious.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.734212

The injection molding protects your hands well, but can be rough on your knuckles if you don't use hand-wraps. They are pretty light with a lot of support in the wrist. I can feel a real boost in speed from my other 16 oz gloves. I recommend using these for sparring while maybe getting a set of bag gloves for mitt-drills and bag work, since the tightness may bother your hands if you lay into your punches for an extended period of time. They sure do look cool though.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.734231

He lost his mom this year so it's his first birthday without her. I wanted it to be special for him. I put my right hand into the glove and there's this weird fabric on the inside that doesn't allow your hand to fit inside the glove. Then one glove is obviously bigger than the other.

But, in my opinion they're the best boxing gloves one can find under $100. The real professional boxing gloves are all very pricey but this is a good alternative. I can say that these provide better protection than the Challenger when I tried them and the Elites.

These gloves run a bit tight, I am 115 lbs and the 10 oz were way to small for me, it would cut into my knuckles on my power hand. I ordered the 12 oz and returned the 10, the 12 was a much better fit for me. The style is awesome, I get a lot of compliments.

They don’t get quite as heavy when they fill with sweat as the soft pillowy padding does. That being said, the wrist wrap aperture is pretty big. If you’re just throwing them on without wraps to do some bag work, they aren’t as stable as I would like.

user|R2PA2VDH9VJM31|B085Z85X6N||mike shimojo|3|May 9, 2020|1588989600|The size is SUPER important.|The gloves were nice...had alot of compliments however, due to the location and my profession as a Merchant Mariner who is restricted to the ship by way of MSC, we are not allowed to go ashore to return items. Also it took a long time to arrive and I did ask a question on the size before ordering. I mentioned if there was a size chart for 14oz gloves because I have big hands. When the item arrived I slipped them on and it was snug for my hands. Now being snug is okay but I still need to wrap my hands with Wraps which in turn will make the gloves even tighter...so my rating is a 3 star..🥴|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.734883

I realize kids gloves are cheaper than adult size but still. Bought these four months ago, they get used 4-5 times a week for minimum an hr each time. Other than some small scuff marks on the white part (expected) they have held up very well. The thumbs are still attached, the velcro is still like new, padding is still holding up.This is the first pair of gloves I've ever bought so I don't have any other brands to compare to, but RDX seems to be killing it for durability. The only thing about these, I know all gloves tend to smell eventually but these smelled a little strong right out of the package, and after that smell went away the smell of gloves after multiple uses has stuck to these like no other. Get some of those deodorizers if you get these gloves! :DEDITRDX has updated the design of these gloves, if width of the cuff matters to you, the new design is roughly a half inch wider. The new ones feel a little stiffer, seems to take a little longer to break in and feel slightly less comfortable than the last design, the inside isn't a soft material but more slick so better for wiping down after use but not as comfy when breaking them in.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.734973

Teaching my boy boxing for self defense/confidence, exercise and coordination since he and his younger brother morph into screen zombies. Now these gloves barely come off once he gets home from school until bed time and I'm hoping the novelty doesn't wear off.Starting with 4oz to help develop technique hitting the mitts and standup bag. Will probably get some 8oz when I let him spar me more because the the 4oz aren't exactly soft when you intentionally let your kid get some headshots on you to help make it fun. It's easy to block, parry or bob every punch from a 5yo just starting out, so once in a while we spar (basically I'm just a real life moving punching bag on my knees) and I let him slip one in a headshot every now and then to make it for fun, but a solid cross to the face on these 4oz makes me not want to give him many freebies. Great gloves for working bags and mitts and basic training. When you're ready to let them spar you look for a softer sparring glove. I was surprised how quick his best punch before teaching him basic techniques went from an uncoordinated love tap to packing some heat.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.734980

For any beginners that aren't familiar with the differences in boxing gloves, if you're going to be sparring, you don't want to get the super cheap gloves that are only meant for bag work. Some of those bag work gloves have material like stitching on areas of the glove near the wrist that if it rubs on your sparring partners face will scratch or cut them and your sparring partner will not be happy. I think for any hobbyist that is going to be sparring these are great gloves. They support your wrists well, they're durable, they look good, they're comfortable. They're easy enough to get on and off by yourself.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.735315

Those were garbage and a teammate recommended ringside. I've bought one pair of ringside gloves before that were pretty good but I wanted a pair with more cushion. These delivered. My hands feel very comfortable when hitting the bag and the protection is great for me on the bag and whilst sparring for my partners. The stability of the gloves is nice too. That said, if you're in desperate need of wrist support, these aren't the perfect brand but they absolutely do a great job if you're throwing with proper technique. That said, the weight distribution is a tad front-heavy so that takes some getting used to but I'd say it helps conditioning overall. The color has faded after a bit but that happens with almost any glove when you're hitting a bag thousands of times a week. Final score = 9.5/10.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.735375

The more you use and break them in, it becomes easier to get in. Absorbs punches very well - I am a heavyweight and hit the bag quite hard. Just make sure you wrap your hands properly, but that goes for any gloves. Do not punch without wrapping, or you will be going to the ER (especially if you are just starting to box).

Good gloves for beginners & hitting a heavy bag.|I've only ever used the Ringside Apex Flash Sparring Gloves to hit a heavy bag, but I do like them. The 16-ounce gloves are sufficiently padded and fit well (not too tight, but definitely not too big either) and the velcro hook and loop wrap-around closures keep the gloves secure, no matter how hard you're hitting, but still make taking the gloves off a whole lot easier than some of the other closures out there (hook and loop or otherwise). Wrist support seems pretty good and should offer enough protection as long as your throwing your punches properly (something I don't always do). They seem very durable, with no rips, tears or stitching giving way, and with only the natural wear of the outer design showing that they've been used.For the price, these Ringside Apex sparring gloves are hard to beat. For a beginner, they look and feel like the real deal, and while they won't last forever, they look and (mostly) act the part. If you're just looking for a pair of gloves to hit a heavy bag, these definitely did the job for me.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.735505

However, after buying a few different pairs of gloves, I resolved that they will all be tight when they are new. So I took 2 small wash cloths and stuffed one in each glove, to help the gloves expand faster. It definitely worked, because I was able to use the gloves with wraps without my circulation being cut off lol. Unfortunately I can't remember how long it took for this to work (at least a week or so) but would suggest trying this if you like your gloves but they're too tight. But, I love these gloves and am very satisfied! I don't box that often ( 2-3 times a month) but I have 2 pairs of gloves, and I'm always wearing these!|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.735560

A little snug if you don't have small boy hands. Not much padding either. Other than that, I mean, they look cool. Mainly the gloves are good for sparring, (I know they're sparring gloves)they do not feel good for bag work, incase you were wondering. However even when sparring, I don't really like the way the glove is rounded at the end and the way feels when I make contact.Now the pros, I like how even they feel with the weight distribution, and they feel light. I love the way they look, and I do believe they are decent sparring gloves overall. I'm giving it a 4 because I'd really like to give it a 3.5 rating but there is not an option for that, and I don't feel like it deserves a flat 3.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.735635

Solid craftmanship and TONS of padding on the knuckles, just as advertised. Feels super cushy and yet still generates a powerful punch. Material inside, the lining, is a bit different than most I've tried, and I do find that it makes my hands sweat a lot more than usual. The tight wrist support also adds to that (in this case in a good way since you get good stability), but after a session it feels like I just took my hand out of a bucket of water.

Loved them! The way that fit felt great looked like really good quality. After about 3-4 months I noticed they started to fall apart. Kept training until one day the inside seam busted and starting putting styrofoam padding all over the place. At this time it had only been 6 months since I got the gloves. I’m not bashing the gloves good to start out with just know you will need a new pair very soon. I’d honestly spend the money and buy something better then these Hyabusa, Twins or even Yokkao (if your order straight from them it will take bit to get them because they are hand made from Thailand) but well worth it. When I called Ringside all they said was there is 120 day warranty on them and there was nothing they could do. Understandable.

The Ringside Apex Flash Sparring Gloves not only keep your hand protected, but add a little sizzle with “flash” styling.These sparring-quality gloves are made with a special Injected Molded Foam process to create a single 2” layer of protective foam, giving your hand more protection and lasting longer than layered foam gloves. The synthetic leather shell is easy to clean. Note that the thumb is attached to the fingers for safety, so these gloves are really only meant for boxing. The breathable palm mesh and perforations help keep the gloves ventilated. The gloves also have grip bars to help you make a tight fist.The gloves have hook and loop wrist wraps to keep your gloves in place and help provide wrist support. I found these gloves to have a snug fit, but they are perfect for my wife–be sure you get the right size. The 14 oz gloves are recommended for those up to 5’ 8” tall or who weigh less than 150 pounds; the 16 oz gloves are recommended for those taller than 5’ 8” or who weigh more than 150 pounds.All in all, these are very nice gloves. The molded foam provides plenty of padding to absorb the shock from hard punches and the form helps you keep a tight fist.

On one had they're pretty good quality gloves for working out in. Construction is nice and they look good too. I like the mesh palm, it does help to keep your hands cooler/less sweaty.However there are a couple downsides. They're TIGHT with wraps on. Much more so than my other gloves. That's not a deal breaker, it's not like they're cutting off circulation or anything like that, just takes a little bit to get them on.The real problem is the padding. Specifically when I'm using them for heavy bag workouts, in orthodox my right knuckle is getting sore in 1 round. It actually feels like if I'm stupid and hit the heavy bag with 12oz gloves. This might be fit, might just need breaking in or they might be REALLY tailored for sparring since they are marketed as such. I'll give them a little time.Anyway, they seem to be a good value.

Feels very small with big hands.|"The material holds up well, and all in all for the price they are suitable probably for most people. However I do have larger hands and these seem to run fairly small. It is a very tight squeeze even after getting broken in, but more importantly length wise my fingertips are pushing against the very end of the glove, even stretching the material around them any time I make a fist. They are fairly uncomfortable even after a few months of use. I am 6'4"" 207lbs so these will probably be amazing gloves for a more average sized person, but if you have big, long hands these may not be the gloves for you. I am dealing with them hoping I can break them in to the point of some comfort, but if you are any larger than I am I just have to say I can't recommend them. They almost feel like they could be youth-adolescent sized but I don't see that listed on the description. I wish I could have tried them on because I was able to notice all of my issues with the glove the first time I put them on, but that just doesn't work for online shopping, which is why I am still giving 4 stars. The gloves are durable and don't have any ripping or tearing or wear after many hours on the heavy bag and mitts.TL;DR - IF you aren't a person with large hands, these are exceptional gloves. If you are, expect discomfort, and a long, possibly infinite, break-in period."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.735839

I have had them for about 2 months, and the material on the inside wrist of one glove (under where the strap wraps around) has started to fall apart. The edge has completely disintegrated, while the rest looks mostly like the upper layer of material has separated and is coming off. The diamond pattern on the gloves is peeling off one square at a time.The damage is so far cosmetic and away from the contact areas of the gloves. It seems like a defect more then damage from use.

It provides great padding and resistance, but, because of the extra distance from the knuckle to the exterior of the glove, it took a little while to get used to. I, personally, believe that it also provides a little bit of a rebound effect that offers resistance and might be helping me punch through my target a little more. Once I got used to it, anyway.I also have a pair of Ringside Lace IMF Tech Boxing Kickboxing Muay Thai Training Gloves Sparring Punching Mitts. Although I really enjoy the classic look of the lace-ups, the Velcro-style wrist wrap on the Apex gloves enables me to easily put the gloves on and take them off when no one else is around to help me out. Believe it or not, I also feel like the Velcro-style closure provides a tighter and more secure fit.While I’m comparing the two sets, I’ll also say that the vented palm on the Apex gloves does breathe surprisingly well. Additionally, the lace-ups have a lining that tends to stick to the skin when the sweat is flowing, which actually did a number on my fingers below the wrap. The Apex gloves, however, have a lining that is soft and cotton-like; sticking is not an issue.All in all, these are great gloves. I really enjoy them. If you are trying to decide between the Ringside Apex or Lace-ups, I would recommend the Apex – unless you need lace-ups, of course.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.735946

I can't attest to using these in a pro boxing manner, butI enjoy hitting a reflex bag that I've set up in my garage for some extra exercise, and these work perfectly. The fit is great on my hands and they don't slip around or slide as I'm punching the bag. They wrap securely around my wrists which increases their stability and keeps my wrists stable while punching the bag. Overall the quality seems excellent. The leather and the stitching seems very high quality and like they will last for a very long time, especially for the type of use I'm giving them. Your hand will always get sweaty in boxing gloves, but these gloves seem to wick moisture and keep my hands cooler and dryer than gloves I've used in the past. These is a lot of padding in the knuckle area which really helps to protect my hands and keep them from getting too tired over a long session.

Most importantly, they were fairly comfortable right from the box. With the construction of glove’s padding, they are not supposed to have a break-in requirement. I think they are getting more comfortable as I use them but I suppose it could just be a reaction because they are new-to-me. The injected molded foam (IMF) padding is 2.25” thick in the molded construction of the Apex Flash glove. I think they feel well on the strikes and light back-and-forth for fitness workouts I do.The outside feels like a quality, albeit synthetic leather, that rivals other brands I have used. I have the red/white which features additional gold trim and accents on the thumb and under the finger compartment. If you want full grain leather, Ringside has the Predator model among others.Of the discrepancies from other models I’ve used, my other gloves feature a double-adjustable wrist wrap, which is great for a more supportive fit for me. These Apex gloves include a fairly long 3.5” wrap around Velcro closure that still seems sufficient. However, my other gloves were also more expensive than the Apex. I would prioritize any key features among several gloves for your needs and comfort.Finally, on the matter of sizing, I do think they run a tad small, which works out great for me with smaller hands and with wraps. The size chart from Ringside recommends the 14oz. gloves for height 5’8” or less and less than 150lbs. The 16oz is for larger than those height/weight metrics according to Ringside (see photo).|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.735965

The mesh palm piece is a nice touch to keep your hands from getting super sweaty. If you plan on wearing any sort of wrap on your hands make sure you order a glove size that will accommodate this. These particular gloves seem to run a little small, so if you have larger hands, be aware. So far they've held up to daily workouts, but this is the first pair of Ringside gloves I've owned. Prior gloves have had problems with poor velcro closures that stopped sticking after about a month or splits/cracks would develop in the curved part of the glove due to too thin pleather. I'm hoping that the pleather on these gloves is thicker than previous pairs I've had. All-in-all, a decent set of sparring gloves that don't break the bank.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.735967

They worked fine, except they are a little bulky for my frame. I'm a female, 5'7"", ~120lbs, and when the gloves are on they reach a little over halfway down my arm. The problem was about six weeks after I bought them and started using them in class regularly the velcro patch on the left glove pulled away from the glove completely when taking them off. The force of the velcro on the strap actually pulled it off, and it's now barely held to the glove by two threads. It's not something that can be fixed, so now I have to look to purchase a different set for when these inevitably fail completely. Not a great deal for only four months of use."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.735993

I have been boxing for 6 years, and back then most gloves had all leather and not mesh. I have owned three sets of Everlast gloves, and i unfortunately hadto return my previous purchase. The first two sets of gloves were great, both 16oz and 12 oz, they lasted for almost 6 years. The most recent purchase i had was a disappointment, because they started to use a mesh material on the inside of the glove. This material doesn't have any support, the glove just moves around. This Apex glove has majority of leather on the inside of the palm, which provides support and quality. So happy with my purchase.Pros:The leather provides support and helps the glove from sliding up and down.

I Sparred with them around 5 times vigorously and can tell you that these gloves really are great quality for the price!For comfort I rate these gloves 4/5Everything about the inside of these gloves feel great on your hands! The lining is comfortable and the fit is very tight. The only gripe I have is with the area that encloses your fingertips. The fit on the fingertips is too tight and causes some discomfort, other than that, highly comfortable gloves.For durability I rate these gloves a 4/5After about 5 days of hard sparring, 2 of the stitchings came loose, the material is also not leather so we will see how they hold up, but other than that, very durable.For hand and wrist protection I rate these gloves 5/5!If you want gloves that will have a tight grip on your wrists and protect your hands with great padding look no further than these. The IMF technology that of these gloves are filled with is truly great for the price you pay for them. The locking on the wrist is also very well done with a full wrap around the completely and closes your wrist with a tight lock, overall one of the most protective gloves I've ever put on!For partner protection I write these gloves 5/5!Like I said above the IMF technology is a really great, especially for when you are punching your sparring partner the padding is loosely distributed and very springy. Every single one of my sparring partners noticed a significant difference in these gloves and how comfortable there were to get hit with. Overall, fantastic in this department.I rate the aesthetic of these gloves a 5/5!One of the main reasons I bought these gloves is because of the excellent job they did on the look. I'm usually not a fan of flashy colorful gloves but ringside nailed it on these ones! These gloves look even better in person because of the way they reflect the light and the texture of them.

The padding shifted when I would hit, my hands couldn't fit in the gloves with wraps which isn't good. The wrist support was so so. and the outside of the glove material is a cloth like substance. They look good but that's about as good as they get (for me). I only used them the once and immediately returned them.I can't give a review based on durability but, I was disappointed since my pair of ringside bag gloves held up well and gave good support.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.736093

Heavy bag, light sparring - they're perfect.I've seen some comments that these may not be a full 16 oz. I'm not sure about that.If so, I feel bad for sparring with these.Otherwise, they are awesome gloves. The foam padding over the fist is more than adequate to absorb a great deal of impact but still communicate the feel of a punch snapping vs pushing, landing vs glancing, etc.They're not so big that you can cover your whole face with one like some other of those big pillowy gloves.The wrist support is pretty solid when snugged down tight.EASY on and off, unlike all of these wacky X-closures and overlapping straps that you need an engineering degree to take off.Great, great gloves.I'll buy another pair if these ever give out (maybe not in ostentatious gold, though)|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.736097

I was a Fan of Neverlast for Quite sometime before i actually started taking boxing serious. Once I started Sparring and Enjoying the Training i was doing every other day, I neededto up my Gloves. I searched everywhere for nice but not to cheap gloves. I was going to buy some from my coach for 65 at the Boxing Gym but felt as they were way to much. So i searched for the gloves everyone had at my Gym and found these ringside 16oz. 16oz is the best Gloves especially since 16oz is the recommended weight size for sparring. ive had these for about 1 month or more and a little stitching is coming out but you can always sew it back on. If youre a heavy hitter and you do hit bags or spar often DO NOT expect these gloves to last forever. Just like anything else with heavy use, you wont expect it to last forever!! Be opened minded to these gloves before purchasing, and do some research or even ask people you box with what they recommend, because sometimes 2 cents from others really does help get you the best product that suits you.Now let me break down the Gloves. When the Gloves came in, i was shocked at how nice they were. Just looking at the gloves and unpacking fron the Plastic bag was amazing. You smell the synthetic leather and right when you put the gloves on the cushion inside the gloves are so nice and fresh. The Gap in betweent the top of your hand and wrist is flexible and isnt really an issue if you know how to throw punches. if you dont know how to throw punches right you will hurt your wrists and it takes very long to recover. The feel of these gloves are so nice, they feel long and the velcro is v nice. Ive sparred about 8-10 times with these gloves since jve had them and since theyre 16oz they really do help with speed. I do recommend the Gloves to Beginners that want to take the Sport serious and training serious.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.736196

The injection molding protects your hands well, but can be rough on your knuckles if you don't use hand-wraps. They are pretty light with a lot of support in the wrist.

Gloves|This is a pretty good pair of boxing gloves from KUANG QUAN.I ordered the 12 ounce pair so they can be used for heavy bag work, focus pads or sparring. The gloves are made of PU leather (polyurethane leather or “pleather”) with plenty of foam padding and shaped in a curve that naturally starts making your hand into a fist. Then the interior “grab bar” helps you complete a solid fist. That’s all fairly common in modern boxing gloves but KUANG QUAN does add a mesh insert in the palm to assist in ventilation (and drying out after use). They’re finished off with a 2.5” wide hook and loop wrist band that keeps the gloves secure on your hand during the most intense workout.Time will tell how durable they will be but they held up well on the heavy bag today. No softening or deforming of the foam padding, no abrasions or tears in the leather, no slipping on the hands while punching or during impact. If anything changes, I’ll update this review but as for now, I recommend them as good, low cost training gloves.|False|2023-05-25 20:31:25.736321

I'm just getting into boxing at home and wanted to find something cheap, but with decent quality. I came across both sets of the gloves shown in the photos on Amazon. It turns out that both gloves are branded by ""Fiving"". As photos don't do justice for some items sold online, I couldn't choose between the two. So I bought both. The other set of gloves (ASIN B08SJBGM9F) look like an older model and both almost identical on Amazon.Had I of not purchased both sets of these gloves at the same time, I doubt I may have noticed and or pointed out the differences between the two models. So my review is going to seem a bit comparative between the two.Anyhow, the gloves for this listing are less bulkier than the other gloves. Since I'm just starting out, I wanted to opt for something that doesn't look huge on my hands, while still getting the job done. The other gloves have a much longer pocket for your fingers. So when putting them on, you feel like you have to really push your fingers into the glove to fill out the length of the pocket if that makes sense. You're essentially having to curve your fingers more into the glove to make the fit feel more comfortable. Those maybe better for someone with extra long fingers or something.Although both of models of gloves have the same width velcro straps, these gloves have a much narrower velcro strip on the glove itself. The gloves on this listing are a bit more rounder looking, where as the other gloves seem a bit flat. Although both sets of gloves have breathable mesh within the palm area of the glove, these gloves have a much wider mesh for air flow.I can only assume that these are the newer model of the other gloves. Not sure. Anyhow, see my video comparing the two side by side.Only time will tell how these gloves hold up, but so far I'm giving them 5 stars."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.736328

To correct this issue for the double-end bag, I bought a heavier 14oz pair of gloves (Ringside Apex) and these gloves had a thicker padding and my knuckles were fine after each use; so it made me believe these Venum 12oz gloves are not suited for impact; but don’t get me wrong, these gloves are my favourite in terms of the build quality and sturdiness.The fit of these gloves are fairly snug for small sized hands with wraps, so I would imagine people with medium to large sized hands may have a problem with the fitting.Overall I am satisfied with the product and would recommend to people who are just starting the sport, have smaller hands, and not for heavy impact.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.736548

These gloves fit perfectly when I'm not wearing quick wraps... when I'm wearing quick wraps the gloves bulge to the point of looking like the stitching is about to burst.Other then that though, the glove is solid for its price range having thick padding and support all around. The padding is really really firm though so I'm hoping it'll be a bit better after a break in period.

My first impressions are good though. The gloves fit well, feel supportive of the wrists, and the shape of the glove allows for a good natural connection to the bag while punching. I switched from Ringside because the shape of the Ringside gloves seemed to force my pinky and ring finger knuckles to connect first which was causing a lot of bloodied knuckles and poor punches.

It comes saying it’s for kids at 8oz but no worries if you have small hands it will fit you. You just might have to go without wraps if your hands are bigger. If you want to use as little protection as possible but still have gloves these will work. These are slightly easier on my hands and wrist as compare to 4oz. But do not use these to spar or for everyday hard training. They do not give the proper amount of protection for that. As for beginners, I recommend you get another glove that has more protection.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.736648

After using them for nearly a year, i tried a different set of (same weight) gloves and realized how terrible the fit on these is. The finger / knuckle area is HUGE and causes my hands to slide around, inside the glove, on impact. After getting into sparring I started to get blisters on my thumb / index / middle finger knuckles on both hands. I'd box every day and the blisters never had the opportunity to heal up. Additionally, the padding on the knuckles has started to crack and peel.I recently purchased a pair of T3's and give these out as loaners to friends of mine who come to class. That's about all the Venum Contender gloves are good for, to tell you the truth. If you're going to be serious about boxing I'd suggest you spend a little extra coin and bypass these gloves. In fact, just bypass Venum boxing / mma gloves altogether......|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.736669

The palm section in size/spacing, does not match the hand size/spacing section. Meaning- if you have a large hand, the palm section will fit nicely and the fingertips may be more cramped. Similarly, if you have a small, the fingertip section will fit snug and the palm section will be too large. Must wear wraps with these gloves. The wrist wrap section does not take into account for small wrists so does not close tight enough without major overlapping of glove flaps.

My wife bought me these Venums, and I immediately felt the difference in quality when I strapped these on. The fit is nice and snug with hand wraps. The quality/durability of the glove is a huge upgrade from the Everlasts. The padding of the glove allows me to go hard on a heavy bag for 5 rounds without any sort of hand or wrist soreness. I've been using these gloves at least 4 times a week for the last 3 weeks, and I am super pleased to have these for my workouts.P.s. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I haven't had the luxury to of using more ""top of the line"" gloves. This is only my second pair ever."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.737421

I got them as a backup pair just in case my Titles tore or something, but I will probably never use them. I may keep them for a sparring partner or something, but they are pretty cheap. I wouldn't recommend them for any real boxing use. There are other brands with real leather at a similar price. There is no reason to purchase these when there are so many better products out there.

They probably aren't as bad as what most people would give two stars, but the description that comes up with two stars (""I don't like it"") is true.I am a woman who has been taking kickboxing/boxing exercise classes about 3 times a week for about 6 years now. The classes I take require handwraps and gloves because I am either hitting a heavy bag or mitts being held by someone (I alternate between the two). I had had two different pairs of gloves in the past- both of which I had purchased at the gym itself. This was my first pair to buy online. Both the ones I got from the gym and these were 14 oz, so its a fair comparison there. I found they definitely did not compare to the ones I bought at the gym- which were definitely more expensive ($60+ vs, $20+). The gloves are technically fine and functional. I am not sure if a beginner or first-time glove buyer would have issues with them. However, compared the gym gloves, I felt the inside lining on these felt cheaper/not as nice. I also found these gloves OK for mitt work, but did not like them on the heavy bag because it didn't feel like they provided as much cushioning.I am really not sure if it is solely a price-quality difference... where no cheaper gloves will be as nice as the ones at the gym. I plan to purchase another pair of affordable gloves on Amazon- the Sansabul Essential GEL- which is priced about the same as these were- to test that theory. Give me a few weeks and I will let you know how that goes."|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.737438

He would complain of hand pain after bag sessions with the 6 oz'ers he was using. Now he uses these Venums with the Ringside gel wraps underneath. No more hand soreness and the other boys appreciate the added padding and weight when he spars them. The only knock is that he complains that he can't make a solid fist in these gloves, so I think there is a break in period due to his smaller hands.

Dan Weeks|3|April 20, 2022|1650420000|Great for Casuals, not so much for Hobbyists.|Everlast has been the standard for boxing gear for a long time, so one would think that it could stand up to regular training.And I suppose as long as you don't go too hard against the heavy bag, these are fine.For casuals and beginners, you really can't beat the price.But for those of us who go a little harder, and are a little stronger, these don't last very long.I've gone through 2 of these in a matter of months.The leather is durable enough, but the inside nylon lining tore open after the first day of hard bag work.And the tear of course just kept getting bigger, to the point where now I'm shedding stuffing every time I take them off.I'd like to stick to Everlast, but the price point advantage disappears if I have to keep buying new gloves every few weeks.So if you're just starting out, I'd recommend these.If you're a regular and you hit harder on the heavy bag, you probably want to find a more durable set.|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.737565

These gloves will not last long if you’re a serious or more advanced user. The padding is very thin and I can feel everything through the gloves right into my hands. If you’re looking to get started and are not going to rely on these to last you over time it’s a decent purchase for the price.

Not knowing which size fits me the best, I bought both.I can return one of them for a refund.(see, I don't have a CREDIT card, so I can't try now and pay later!)Pros:The gloves come in a box with a zipper lid.Unzip around three sides of the lid, and it hinges on the fourth side.Neat.My grip on a bowling ball suggests that I have either Large or Extra Large hands.The 16-oz gloves are better suited for a 180-pound man with XL hands, while the 14-oz gloves are better suited for a 160-pound man with Large hands.I weigh 170!Right in the middle.There is an elastic velcro strap that I can pull around my arm above my wrist and chinch the glove up for a good fit.I am a beginner with boxing gloves, so I rated 5 stars for beginners and comfort.Five stars for durability, but time will tell.I can say this much:I sure wouldn't've dared try to punch the bag with my bare fists.My knuckles cannot take that kind of abuse.I can give it a good sock with the gloves on, however.I have been able to use the side of my fist in a sideways motion against the bag.Cons:I'm not too fond of the way the size chart is not presented on Amazon.""Fit:""(Link:) ""True to size. Order usual size."" (/Link)There is no readily available size chart to consult.Having never bought gloves before, I had no idea what my ""usual size"" is.I eventually found a link among answered questions, as I recall.There is an excellent page about glove size versus body weight, height, and hand size out there.Make it more readily visible here, please!"|True|2023-05-25 20:31:25.737600
