    "<b>Project Overview</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to draw insights from customer reviews to provide Amazon sellers and marketers ways to improve their products and marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses a specific type of machine learning called Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assign categories to reviews so that sellers can understand how customers feel about their products without having to read every review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three major NLP tools are used in this project - Spacy, OpenAI, and Distilbart.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Using NLP to Process Reviews</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using machine learning tools requires balancing output quality, performance speed, and cost. OpenAI's models are some of the best, however, using them can be expensive at scale, so I'll use free NLP tools for simpler tasks. Spacy processes the reviews prior to sending them to OpenAI's models for categories, and Distilbart applies those categories to the reviews. Both Spacy and Distilbart are free."

      "After testing the Hayabusa S4 Boxing Gloves for several weeks, my opinion is somewhat divided. The design is undeniably striking, and they do draw attention at the gym. Additionally, once they're on, they provide a comfortable, secure fit that offers ample support during training.Nonetheless, there are a couple of aspects that need improvement. Firstly, I found it quite challenging to insert and remove my hands from the gloves when they become sweaty. The inner lining seems to stick to my hands, which causes inconvenience during breaks in my training sessions. It would be great if the fabric were more resistant to moisture or designed to be more breathable.Another issue is the snugness of the 12oz gloves, which is the appropriate size for my weight category. While I appreciate the importance of a secure fit for better control, the gloves feel excessively tight. This makes it even more troublesome to wear and remove them, especially when factoring in the fabric problem.In summary, I rate these Hayabusa S4 Boxing Gloves with 3 stars. The impressive design and sense of security are commendable, but the inner fabric and fit could use some enhancements. If the manufacturer can address these concerns, these gloves have the potential to be a top-rated product. Until that happens, I'll be on the lookout for updates in future versions.\n",

I’m embarrassed to say the dust bin was completely full. I repeated this process, after charging was complete, three times. Eventually, there was no more dog hair in the dust bin. All the floors were clean. EVEN UNDER THE BEDS!\\n\\n    I live alone with my dog, so my house is very quiet. It did seem a little noisy but definitely not as noisy as a normal vacuum sweeper.\\n\\n    I also used the mopping feature. It was much like my steamer without the steam. I sprayed the floor with fresh smelling cleaner (Mr. Clean) and then placed Beastie down to do a spot clean in the kitchen. It did a great job. There is zero noise when it’s mopping.. that was nice.\\n\\n    My dog sheds A LOT. I had to dust mop the main kitchen/living room area and all rooms on the weekends. With this vacuum, I toss the dog toys onto a throw rug that is super plush and set it aside. The vacuum went over all the rest of the throw rugs in the bathrooms and office with no issues at all. It took about an hour for this vacuum to clean my whole house… a task that takes me several hours with the dust mop.\\n\\n    I run this vacuum every morning. I get almost giddy when I walk through the house now and see and feel how clean my floors are!\\n\\n    My only worry is what to do with my spare time now that I don’t have to dust mop… this was definitely a game changer!\\n',\n",

    "    This vacuum was fairly easy to set up on the app (I’m a grandma, so it wasn’t a snap, but I eventually got it done and connected to Alexa)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once the vacuum was charged, I told Alexa to start Beastie (Yes, from the movie Malificent)\n",
    "    Beastie started off on a journey throughout the house, then returned to the home base to charge. I’m embarrassed to say the dust bin was completely full. I repeated this process, after charging was complete, three times. Eventually, there was no more dog hair in the dust bin. All the floors were clean. EVEN UNDER THE BEDS!\n",

    "    I live alone with my dog, so my house is very quiet. It did seem a little noisy but definitely not as noisy as a normal vacuum sweeper.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I also used the mopping feature. It was much like my steamer without the steam. I sprayed the floor with fresh smelling cleaner (Mr. Clean) and then placed Beastie down to do a spot clean in the kitchen. It did a great job. There is zero noise when it’s mopping.. that was nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "    My dog sheds A LOT. I had to dust mop the main kitchen/living room area and all rooms on the weekends. With this vacuum, I toss the dog toys onto a throw rug that is super plush and set it aside. The vacuum went over all the rest of the throw rugs in the bathrooms and office with no issues at all. It took about an hour for this vacuum to clean my whole house… a task that takes me several hours with the dust mop.\n",
